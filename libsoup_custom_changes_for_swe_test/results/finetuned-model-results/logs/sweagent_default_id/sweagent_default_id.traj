          "content": "SETTING:\nYou are a software developer with extensive knowledge of Libsoup Package, and its commit history.\n\nYour primary job is to backport a patch written for LATEST version of Libsoup, into the OLD version of Libsoup.\n\nFor this, you will be given a specially designed command line interface. THIS is NOT the standard command line interface.\nThis interface has its own Rules & limitations, work IN THOSE LIMITATIONS Only.\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you 100 lines of a file at a time.\nThe special interface DOES NOT allow any interactive commands like `vi`. Non interactive commands like `cat`, `find`, `grep`, etc are allowed.\nAlso, it has some specific commands with PROPER LIMITATIONS: (like `OPEN` (File ONLY), `VIEW` (Directory ONLY) etc.)\n\nTo backport the patch, DO NOT Try to Cherrypick.\nApply the patch MANUALLY.\n\nFirst, read the full patch and understand the changes in the patch.\nThen, find what files, functions are being changed.\nThen, locate those files and functions in the OLD code base.\n\nIf you cannot find an exact match, use your knowledge of Libsoup COMMIT HISTORY.\nMention what files, functions in the LATEST version map to what files, functions in the OLD version.\nThen based on this, mention potential filenames, functionnames that the Latest patch might be referring to in the Old code base.\n\nThen, use the special interface to search the codebase and make corresponding changes to the codebase based on the patch.\nuse commands like `find`, `goto`, `grep`, etc. to find the relevant code in the OLD code base and backport the patch.\nuse regex to find filenames/paths, function names, etc. in case exact matches are not found.\n\nExample:\nif the Patch changes `src/lib/soup-foo.c` file,\n1. First, try to find the exact file in the OLD code base.\n2. If you cannot find the exact file, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history, to map filename of `src/lib/soup-foo.c` in the LATEST version to filename in the OLD version.\n3. if you still cannot find the exact file, try to find potential filenames using regex search or searching contents of file.\n4. Always check your findings with your knowledge of libsoup commit history, and ensure that file you found is indeed the correct file.\n\nExample:\nif the Patch changes a function named `soup_foo_bar()` in `src/soup_decoder/is-bar.c` file,\n1. First, try to find the exact function in the OLD code base.\n2. If you cannot find the exact function, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history, to map function name of `soup_foo_bar()` in the LATEST version to OLD version.\nfor example, it might be named `soup_foo_bar_v2()` in the OLD version, or it might have been moved to some other file, or broken into multiple functions, etc.\nbased on this, make a list of potential matches.\n\nTry to PRESERVE the original patch as much as possible, including comments and formatting.\nYou will be penalized for changes that deviate from the patch logic unnecessarily.\n\nMake sure that all your search, edits are within the `--code-base` directory.\nAny changes outside this directory will FAIL the task immediately.\n\nThe files & directories are very large.\nif you try to open a very large file, or list a very large directory, it will take up too many tokens and you will be penalized.\nSo, use commands like `find`, `grep`, etc. to locate files and functions and then use commands like `goto` to jump to specific lines.\n\nTo navigate/edit the codebase using the special interface, invoke the interface with a function call/tool call.\n\nGive special importance to the indentation and whitespaces in the code which are related to syntax.\nFor example, if you are looking at this file:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello world\")\n\nand you want to edit the file to read:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello\")\n    print(\"world\")\n\nyour search string should be `Hello world` and your replace string should be `\"Hello\"\\n    print(\"world\")`\n(note the extra spaces before the print statement!).\nYou could also get the same result by search for `    print(\"Hello world\")` and replace with `    print(\"Hello\")\\n    print(\"world\")`.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>)\n(Current directory: <cwd>)\nbash-$\n\nFirst, you should ALWAYS include a general thought about what you're going to do next.\nThe thought should either be based on Last Observation or Your Libsoup Commit History knowledge.\nThen, for every response, you must include exactly ONE tool call/function call.\n\nNote that the special interface DOES NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them. Any command that require interactive session like \"git show\", \"git log\", etc., will not work. So, DON'T USE ANY INTERACTIVE SESSION COMMANDS OR THEIR DERIVATIVES LIKE `git log --grep=`, `git show HEAD`, `git diff --cached`, etc.,. When you want to run these commands, redirect them to a temporary file and open it for reading. For example, `git log --oneline > /backport/tmp/git_log.txt`.",

          "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n  If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n  Then start trying to fix it.\n  When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n  If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n  so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /testbed)\nbash-$",

Both the `original.patch` file and the `code_base` directory are available in the current working directory.\nFirst move the `original.patch` file to `/root/original.patch` and then change your working directory to the `code_base` directory by running `cd code_base`. \nNote that ANY Changes outside code_base directory, for instance to the original.patch file, will FAIL the task immediately.\n\nRead the patch file carefully and understand the changes it is making. Then, make the necessary changes in the code base, commit the changes, generate a new patch with `git format-patch -1 HEAD`, and then submit the changes using the `submit <patch_file>` command.\n\nYour git username is `AllSpark` and your email is `allspark@microsoft.com`.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your special-interface terminal session has started. You can use any bash NON-Interactive commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIf exact matches do not exist, use your knowledge of Libsoup commit history to find potential matches based on what files, functions of New Version Map to in the old version.\nNote that these are ONLY POTENTIAL matches, so make sure to verify them by checking the contents of the files and functions. use regex, `find`, `grep`, etc. to further improve your search.\nAlways understand the patch logic, the file content and ensure that the changes you are making are correct & preserve the original patch logic as much as possible.\n\nGENERAL IMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. It is okay to scroll only if you cannot determine the location by other means. Similarly when searching for a function, instead of scrolling down, use the search command to find the function name.\n\n3. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally to write code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it. ALWAYS USE PROPER INDENTATION WHEN EDITING FILES EVEN IF THE SYNTAX IS CORRECT WITHOUT INDENTATION. Code readability is important.\n\n4. Do not try to install any packages with `pip`, `conda`, or any other way. This is NOT ALLOWED. If the environment is not set up correctly, try to fix the issue without executing python code or running any tests that require the package installed. DO NOT Use interactive commands either. You have ONE toolcall per response, and the toolcall should be complete in itself. You wont be able to interact with it.\n\n5. Preserve the comments from the original patch whenever possible. They are important for understanding the code.\n\n6. In case exact matches are unavaialable, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history & New-Code to Old-Code mapping to find potential matches. But always verify your knowledge by checking the contents of the files and functions.\n\n7. You're working on a really big repo. So,  DO NOT use `ls -R` command to list all the files in the repo. Instead, use `find` command to find the files you want to edit. For example, if you want to find a file named `foo.py`, use `find . -name foo.py`.\nAlso make sure you understand interface limitations, OPEN files only, View directories only, etc.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n\n1. You don't need to worry about testing the fix. Try minimal self testing if available. But if it is not available or not running properly, don't worry about it.\n\n2. Read the changes to be applied from the original patch carefully. The `open` command only shows 100 lines, if the patch is longer make sure you scroll down to see the complete file. Make sure you understand all the chunks of the patch that need to be manually applied. Print all the description of changes it does in your thoughts as it will be served to you in the history in future prompts. And start making changes one by one.\n\n3. Locate relevant code using the find and search commands. `open` the file you want to edit. Use these tools most of the time to make yourself familier with the code base. Better understanding is preferred.\n\n4. Your knowlege of libsoup commit history is a powerful tool, list out in thoughts the 'Old-Code' to 'New-Code' mappings and use it to find potential file, function, line numbers.\nThis is NOT absolute, and you must verify your findings by checking the contents of the files and functions.\nTry this only once, and your potential matches not work, use special-interface commands to navigate and find the relevant code.\nAlways prefer codebase search over your knowledge of commit history.\n\n5. Use the `edit` command to perform edits.\n\nTOOL USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. The Tool Command 'OPEN' is ONLY to open files. DO NOT try to OPEN directories, this will FAIL the entire task instantly. Use 'VIEW' command to view directories, and 'OPEN' for files.\nFor example, DO NOT try to OPEN '/swe_repo/code_base/' since it is a directory and this will FAIL the entire task instantly.\n\n2. The file contents are TOO LARGE, if you try to OPEN entire file, it will take up too many tokens. Try to find function names, lines, etc using regex, or ask to cat 10-30 lines of file code at a time.\n\n3. Contents of Directories are TOO LARGE, do not try to use 'ls -R' on them. find specific files. use regex.\n\n4. Interactive Commands like 'vi' DO NOT WORK AT ALL. DO NOT USE THEM. If you try to use them, it will FAIL the entire task instantly. Use Commands like cat to open a file.\n\n5. You can Only Work on libsoup repo. (--code-repo). DO NOT try to open or edit any other files outside this repo. If you try to do so, it will FAIL the entire task instantly.\n   Do NOT in any way change the original patch. You DO NOT have permissions outside the code repo.\n\n(Open file: )\n(Current directory: /swe_repo)\nbash-$",

Non interactive commands like `cat`, `find`, `grep`, etc are allowed.\nAlso, it has some specific commands with PROPER LIMITATIONS: (like `OPEN` (File ONLY), `VIEW` (Directory ONLY) etc.)\n\nTo backport the patch, DO NOT Try to Cherrypick.\nApply the patch MANUALLY.\n\nFirst, read the full patch and understand the changes in the patch.\nThen, find what files, functions are being changed.\nThen, locate those files and functions in the OLD code base.\n\nIf you cannot find an exact match, use your knowledge of Libsoup COMMIT HISTORY.\nMention what files, functions in the LATEST version map to what files, functions in the OLD version.\nThen based on this, mention potential filenames, functionnames that the Latest patch might be referring to in the Old code base.\n\nThen, use the special interface to search the codebase and make corresponding changes to the codebase based on the patch.\nuse commands like `find`, `goto`, `grep`, etc. to find the relevant code in the OLD code base and backport the patch.\nuse regex to find filenames/paths, function names, etc. in case exact matches are not found.\n\nExample:\nif the Patch changes `src/lib/soup-foo.c` file,\n1.

If you cannot find the exact file, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history, to map filename of `src/lib/soup-foo.c` in the LATEST version to filename in the OLD version.\n3. if you still cannot find the exact file, try to find potential filenames using regex search or searching contents of file.\n4. Always check your findings with your knowledge of libsoup commit history, and ensure that file you found is indeed the correct file.\n\nExample:\nif the Patch changes a function named `soup_foo_bar()` in `src/soup_decoder/is-bar.c` file,\n1. First, try to find the exact function in the OLD code base.\n2. If you cannot find the exact function, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history, to map function name of `soup_foo_bar()` in the LATEST version to OLD version.\nfor example, it might be named `soup_foo_bar_v2()` in the OLD version, or it might have been moved to some other file, or broken into multiple functions, etc.\nbased on this, make a list of potential matches.\n\nTry to PRESERVE the original patch as much as possible, including comments and formatting.\nYou will be penalized for changes that deviate from the patch logic unnecessarily.\n\nMake sure that all your search, edits are within the `--code-base` directory.\nAny changes outside this directory will FAIL the task immediately.\n\nThe files & directories are very large.\nif you try to open a very large file, or list a very large directory, it will take up too many tokens and you will be penalized.\nSo, use commands like `find`, `grep`, etc. to locate files and functions and then use commands like `goto` to jump to specific lines.\n\nTo navigate/edit the codebase using the special interface, invoke the interface with a function call/tool call.\n\nGive special importance to the indentation and whitespaces in the code which are related to syntax.\nFor example, if you are looking at this file:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello world\")\n\nand you want to edit the file to read:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello\")\n    print(\"world\")\n\nyour search string should be `Hello world` and your replace string should be `\"Hello\"\\n    print(\"world\")`\n(note the extra spaces before the print statement!).\nYou could also get the same result by search for `    print(\"Hello world\")` and replace with `    print(\"Hello\")\\n    print(\"world\")`.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>)\n(Current directory: <cwd>)\nbash-$\n\nFirst, you should ALWAYS include a general thought about what you're going to do next.\nThe thought should either be based on Last Observation or Your Libsoup Commit History knowledge.\nThen, for every response, you must include exactly ONE tool call/function call.\n\nNote that the special interface DOES NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them. Any command that require interactive session like \"git show\", \"git log\", etc., will not work. So, DON'T USE ANY INTERACTIVE SESSION COMMANDS OR THEIR DERIVATIVES LIKE `git log --grep=`, `git show HEAD`, `git diff --cached`, etc.,. When you want to run these commands, redirect them to a temporary file and open it for reading. For example, `git log --oneline > /backport/tmp/git_log.txt`.",

          "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n  If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n  Then start trying to fix it.\n  When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n  If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n  so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /testbed)\nbash-$",

          "content": "PROBLEM_STATEMENT:\n\nBackport the `original.patch` file to the `code_base` directory. Both the `original.patch` file and the `code_base` directory are available in the current working directory.\nFirst move the `original.patch` file to `/root/original.patch` and then change your working directory to the `code_base` directory by running `cd code_base`. \nNote that ANY Changes outside code_base directory, for instance to the original.patch file, will FAIL the task immediately.\n\nRead the patch file carefully and understand the changes it is making. Then, make the necessary changes in the code base, commit the changes, generate a new patch with `git format-patch -1 HEAD`, and then submit the changes using the `submit <patch_file>` command.\n\nYour git username is `AllSpark` and your email is `allspark@microsoft.com`.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your special-interface terminal session has started. You can use any bash NON-Interactive commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIf exact matches do not exist, use your knowledge of Libsoup commit history to find potential matches based on what files, functions of New Version Map to in the old version.\nNote that these are ONLY POTENTIAL matches, so make sure to verify them by checking the contents of the files and functions. use regex, `find`, `grep`, etc. to further improve your search.\nAlways understand the patch logic, the file content and ensure that the changes you are making are correct & preserve the original patch logic as much as possible.\n\nGENERAL IMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. It is okay to scroll only if you cannot determine the location by other means. Similarly when searching for a function, instead of scrolling down, use the search command to find the function name.\n\n3. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally to write code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it. ALWAYS USE PROPER INDENTATION WHEN EDITING FILES EVEN IF THE SYNTAX IS CORRECT WITHOUT INDENTATION. Code readability is important.\n\n4. Do not try to install any packages with `pip`, `conda`, or any other way. This is NOT ALLOWED. If the environment is not set up correctly, try to fix the issue without executing python code or running any tests that require the package installed. DO NOT Use interactive commands either. You have ONE toolcall per response, and the toolcall should be complete in itself. You wont be able to interact with it.\n\n5. Preserve the comments from the original patch whenever possible. They are important for understanding the code.\n\n6. In case exact matches are unavaialable, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history & New-Code to Old-Code mapping to find potential matches. But always verify your knowledge by checking the contents of the files and functions.\n\n7. You're working on a really big repo. So,  DO NOT use `ls -R` command to list all the files in the repo. Instead, use `find` command to find the files you want to edit. For example, if you want to find a file named `foo.py`, use `find . -name foo.py`.\nAlso make sure you understand interface limitations, OPEN files only, View directories only, etc.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n\n1. You don't need to worry about testing the fix. Try minimal self testing if available. But if it is not available or not running properly, don't worry about it.\n\n2. Read the changes to be applied from the original patch carefully. The `open` command only shows 100 lines, if the patch is longer make sure you scroll down to see the complete file. Make sure you understand all the chunks of the patch that need to be manually applied. Print all the description of changes it does in your thoughts as it will be served to you in the history in future prompts. And start making changes one by one.\n\n3. Locate relevant code using the find and search commands. `open` the file you want to edit. Use these tools most of the time to make yourself familier with the code base. Better understanding is preferred.\n\n4. Your knowlege of libsoup commit history is a powerful tool, list out in thoughts the 'Old-Code' to 'New-Code' mappings and use it to find potential file, function, line numbers.\nThis is NOT absolute, and you must verify your findings by checking the contents of the files and functions.\nTry this only once, and your potential matches not work, use special-interface commands to navigate and find the relevant code.\nAlways prefer codebase search over your knowledge of commit history.\n\n5. Use the `edit` command to perform edits.\n\nTOOL USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. The Tool Command 'OPEN' is ONLY to open files. DO NOT try to OPEN directories, this will FAIL the entire task instantly. Use 'VIEW' command to view directories, and 'OPEN' for files.\nFor example, DO NOT try to OPEN '/swe_repo/code_base/' since it is a directory and this will FAIL the entire task instantly.\n\n2. The file contents are TOO LARGE, if you try to OPEN entire file, it will take up too many tokens. Try to find function names, lines, etc using regex, or ask to cat 10-30 lines of file code at a time.\n\n3. Contents of Directories are TOO LARGE, do not try to use 'ls -R' on them. find specific files. use regex.\n\n4. Interactive Commands like 'vi' DO NOT WORK AT ALL. DO NOT USE THEM. If you try to use them, it will FAIL the entire task instantly. Use Commands like cat to open a file.\n\n5. You can Only Work on libsoup repo. (--code-repo). DO NOT try to open or edit any other files outside this repo. If you try to do so, it will FAIL the entire task instantly.\n   Do NOT in any way change the original patch. You DO NOT have permissions outside the code repo.\n\n(Open file: )\n(Current directory: /swe_repo)\nbash-$",

          "content": "SETTING:\nYou are a software developer with extensive knowledge of Libsoup Package, and its commit history.\n\nYour primary job is to backport a patch written for LATEST version of Libsoup, into the OLD version of Libsoup.\n\nFor this, you will be given a specially designed command line interface. THIS is NOT the standard command line interface.\nThis interface has its own Rules & limitations, work IN THOSE LIMITATIONS Only.\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you 100 lines of a file at a time.\nThe special interface DOES NOT allow any interactive commands like `vi`. Non interactive commands like `cat`, `find`, `grep`, etc are allowed.\nAlso, it has some specific commands with PROPER LIMITATIONS: (like `OPEN` (File ONLY), `VIEW` (Directory ONLY) etc.)\n\nTo backport the patch, DO NOT Try to Cherrypick.\nApply the patch MANUALLY.\n\nFirst, read the full patch and understand the changes in the patch.\nThen, find what files, functions are being changed.\nThen, locate those files and functions in the OLD code base.\n\nIf you cannot find an exact match, use your knowledge of Libsoup COMMIT HISTORY.\nMention what files, functions in the LATEST version map to what files, functions in the OLD version.\nThen based on this, mention potential filenames, functionnames that the Latest patch might be referring to in the Old code base.\n\nThen, use the special interface to search the codebase and make corresponding changes to the codebase based on the patch.\nuse commands like `find`, `goto`, `grep`, etc. to find the relevant code in the OLD code base and backport the patch.\nuse regex to find filenames/paths, function names, etc. in case exact matches are not found.\n\nExample:\nif the Patch changes `src/lib/soup-foo.c` file,\n1. First, try to find the exact file in the OLD code base.\n2. If you cannot find the exact file, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history, to map filename of `src/lib/soup-foo.c` in the LATEST version to filename in the OLD version.\n3. if you still cannot find the exact file, try to find potential filenames using regex search or searching contents of file.\n4. Always check your findings with your knowledge of libsoup commit history, and ensure that file you found is indeed the correct file.\n\nExample:\nif the Patch changes a function named `soup_foo_bar()` in `src/soup_decoder/is-bar.c` file,\n1. First, try to find the exact function in the OLD code base.\n2. If you cannot find the exact function, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history, to map function name of `soup_foo_bar()` in the LATEST version to OLD version.\nfor example, it might be named `soup_foo_bar_v2()` in the OLD version, or it might have been moved to some other file, or broken into multiple functions, etc.\nbased on this, make a list of potential matches.\n\nTry to PRESERVE the original patch as much as possible, including comments and formatting.\nYou will be penalized for changes that deviate from the patch logic unnecessarily.\n\nMake sure that all your search, edits are within the `--code-base` directory.\nAny changes outside this directory will FAIL the task immediately.\n\nThe files & directories are very large.\nif you try to open a very large file, or list a very large directory, it will take up too many tokens and you will be penalized.\nSo, use commands like `find`, `grep`, etc. to locate files and functions and then use commands like `goto` to jump to specific lines.\n\nTo navigate/edit the codebase using the special interface, invoke the interface with a function call/tool call.\n\nGive special importance to the indentation and whitespaces in the code which are related to syntax.\nFor example, if you are looking at this file:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello world\")\n\nand you want to edit the file to read:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello\")\n    print(\"world\")\n\nyour search string should be `Hello world` and your replace string should be `\"Hello\"\\n    print(\"world\")`\n(note the extra spaces before the print statement!).\nYou could also get the same result by search for `    print(\"Hello world\")` and replace with `    print(\"Hello\")\\n    print(\"world\")`.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>)\n(Current directory: <cwd>)\nbash-$\n\nFirst, you should ALWAYS include a general thought about what you're going to do next.\nThe thought should either be based on Last Observation or Your Libsoup Commit History knowledge.\nThen, for every response, you must include exactly ONE tool call/function call.\n\nNote that the special interface DOES NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them. Any command that require interactive session like \"git show\", \"git log\", etc., will not work. So, DON'T USE ANY INTERACTIVE SESSION COMMANDS OR THEIR DERIVATIVES LIKE `git log --grep=`, `git show HEAD`, `git diff --cached`, etc.,. When you want to run these commands, redirect them to a temporary file and open it for reading. For example, `git log --oneline > /backport/tmp/git_log.txt`.",

          "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n  If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n  Then start trying to fix it.\n  When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n  If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n  so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /testbed)\nbash-$",

          "content": "PROBLEM_STATEMENT:\n\nBackport the `original.patch` file to the `code_base` directory. Both the `original.patch` file and the `code_base` directory are available in the current working directory.\nFirst move the `original.patch` file to `/root/original.patch` and then change your working directory to the `code_base` directory by running `cd code_base`. \nNote that ANY Changes outside code_base directory, for instance to the original.patch file, will FAIL the task immediately.\n\nRead the patch file carefully and understand the changes it is making. Then, make the necessary changes in the code base, commit the changes, generate a new patch with `git format-patch -1 HEAD`, and then submit the changes using the `submit <patch_file>` command.\n\nYour git username is `AllSpark` and your email is `allspark@microsoft.com`.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your special-interface terminal session has started. You can use any bash NON-Interactive commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIf exact matches do not exist, use your knowledge of Libsoup commit history to find potential matches based on what files, functions of New Version Map to in the old version.\nNote that these are ONLY POTENTIAL matches, so make sure to verify them by checking the contents of the files and functions. use regex, `find`, `grep`, etc. to further improve your search.\nAlways understand the patch logic, the file content and ensure that the changes you are making are correct & preserve the original patch logic as much as possible.\n\nGENERAL IMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. It is okay to scroll only if you cannot determine the location by other means. Similarly when searching for a function, instead of scrolling down, use the search command to find the function name.\n\n3. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally to write code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it. ALWAYS USE PROPER INDENTATION WHEN EDITING FILES EVEN IF THE SYNTAX IS CORRECT WITHOUT INDENTATION. Code readability is important.\n\n4. Do not try to install any packages with `pip`, `conda`, or any other way. This is NOT ALLOWED. If the environment is not set up correctly, try to fix the issue without executing python code or running any tests that require the package installed. DO NOT Use interactive commands either. You have ONE toolcall per response, and the toolcall should be complete in itself. You wont be able to interact with it.\n\n5. Preserve the comments from the original patch whenever possible. They are important for understanding the code.\n\n6. In case exact matches are unavaialable, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history & New-Code to Old-Code mapping to find potential matches. But always verify your knowledge by checking the contents of the files and functions.\n\n7. You're working on a really big repo. So,  DO NOT use `ls -R` command to list all the files in the repo. Instead, use `find` command to find the files you want to edit. For example, if you want to find a file named `foo.py`, use `find . -name foo.py`.\nAlso make sure you understand interface limitations, OPEN files only, View directories only, etc.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n\n1. You don't need to worry about testing the fix. Try minimal self testing if available. But if it is not available or not running properly, don't worry about it.\n\n2. Read the changes to be applied from the original patch carefully. The `open` command only shows 100 lines, if the patch is longer make sure you scroll down to see the complete file. Make sure you understand all the chunks of the patch that need to be manually applied. Print all the description of changes it does in your thoughts as it will be served to you in the history in future prompts. And start making changes one by one.\n\n3. Locate relevant code using the find and search commands. `open` the file you want to edit. Use these tools most of the time to make yourself familier with the code base. Better understanding is preferred.\n\n4. Your knowlege of libsoup commit history is a powerful tool, list out in thoughts the 'Old-Code' to 'New-Code' mappings and use it to find potential file, function, line numbers.\nThis is NOT absolute, and you must verify your findings by checking the contents of the files and functions.\nTry this only once, and your potential matches not work, use special-interface commands to navigate and find the relevant code.\nAlways prefer codebase search over your knowledge of commit history.\n\n5. Use the `edit` command to perform edits.\n\nTOOL USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. The Tool Command 'OPEN' is ONLY to open files. DO NOT try to OPEN directories, this will FAIL the entire task instantly. Use 'VIEW' command to view directories, and 'OPEN' for files.\nFor example, DO NOT try to OPEN '/swe_repo/code_base/' since it is a directory and this will FAIL the entire task instantly.\n\n2. The file contents are TOO LARGE, if you try to OPEN entire file, it will take up too many tokens. Try to find function names, lines, etc using regex, or ask to cat 10-30 lines of file code at a time.\n\n3. Contents of Directories are TOO LARGE, do not try to use 'ls -R' on them. find specific files. use regex.\n\n4. Interactive Commands like 'vi' DO NOT WORK AT ALL. DO NOT USE THEM. If you try to use them, it will FAIL the entire task instantly. Use Commands like cat to open a file.\n\n5. You can Only Work on libsoup repo. (--code-repo). DO NOT try to open or edit any other files outside this repo. If you try to do so, it will FAIL the entire task instantly.\n   Do NOT in any way change the original patch. You DO NOT have permissions outside the code repo.\n\n(Open file: )\n(Current directory: /swe_repo)\nbash-$",

          "content": "SETTING:\nYou are a software developer with extensive knowledge of Libsoup Package, and its commit history.\n\nYour primary job is to backport a patch written for LATEST version of Libsoup, into the OLD version of Libsoup.\n\nFor this, you will be given a specially designed command line interface. THIS is NOT the standard command line interface.\nThis interface has its own Rules & limitations, work IN THOSE LIMITATIONS Only.\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you 100 lines of a file at a time.\nThe special interface DOES NOT allow any interactive commands like `vi`. Non interactive commands like `cat`, `find`, `grep`, etc are allowed.\nAlso, it has some specific commands with PROPER LIMITATIONS: (like `OPEN` (File ONLY), `VIEW` (Directory ONLY) etc.)\n\nTo backport the patch, DO NOT Try to Cherrypick.\nApply the patch MANUALLY.\n\nFirst, read the full patch and understand the changes in the patch.\nThen, find what files, functions are being changed.\nThen, locate those files and functions in the OLD code base.\n\nIf you cannot find an exact match, use your knowledge of Libsoup COMMIT HISTORY.\nMention what files, functions in the LATEST version map to what files, functions in the OLD version.\nThen based on this, mention potential filenames, functionnames that the Latest patch might be referring to in the Old code base.\n\nThen, use the special interface to search the codebase and make corresponding changes to the codebase based on the patch.\nuse commands like `find`, `goto`, `grep`, etc. to find the relevant code in the OLD code base and backport the patch.\nuse regex to find filenames/paths, function names, etc. in case exact matches are not found.\n\nExample:\nif the Patch changes `src/lib/soup-foo.c` file,\n1. First, try to find the exact file in the OLD code base.\n2. If you cannot find the exact file, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history, to map filename of `src/lib/soup-foo.c` in the LATEST version to filename in the OLD version.\n3. if you still cannot find the exact file, try to find potential filenames using regex search or searching contents of file.\n4. Always check your findings with your knowledge of libsoup commit history, and ensure that file you found is indeed the correct file.\n\nExample:\nif the Patch changes a function named `soup_foo_bar()` in `src/soup_decoder/is-bar.c` file,\n1. First, try to find the exact function in the OLD code base.\n2. If you cannot find the exact function, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history, to map function name of `soup_foo_bar()` in the LATEST version to OLD version.\nfor example, it might be named `soup_foo_bar_v2()` in the OLD version, or it might have been moved to some other file, or broken into multiple functions, etc.\nbased on this, make a list of potential matches.\n\nTry to PRESERVE the original patch as much as possible, including comments and formatting.\nYou will be penalized for changes that deviate from the patch logic unnecessarily.\n\nMake sure that all your search, edits are within the `--code-base` directory.\nAny changes outside this directory will FAIL the task immediately.\n\nThe files & directories are very large.\nif you try to open a very large file, or list a very large directory, it will take up too many tokens and you will be penalized.\nSo, use commands like `find`, `grep`, etc. to locate files and functions and then use commands like `goto` to jump to specific lines.\n\nTo navigate/edit the codebase using the special interface, invoke the interface with a function call/tool call.\n\nGive special importance to the indentation and whitespaces in the code which are related to syntax.\nFor example, if you are looking at this file:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello world\")\n\nand you want to edit the file to read:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello\")\n    print(\"world\")\n\nyour search string should be `Hello world` and your replace string should be `\"Hello\"\\n    print(\"world\")`\n(note the extra spaces before the print statement!).\nYou could also get the same result by search for `    print(\"Hello world\")` and replace with `    print(\"Hello\")\\n    print(\"world\")`.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>)\n(Current directory: <cwd>)\nbash-$\n\nFirst, you should ALWAYS include a general thought about what you're going to do next.\nThe thought should either be based on Last Observation or Your Libsoup Commit History knowledge.\nThen, for every response, you must include exactly ONE tool call/function call.\n\nNote that the special interface DOES NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them. Any command that require interactive session like \"git show\", \"git log\", etc., will not work. So, DON'T USE ANY INTERACTIVE SESSION COMMANDS OR THEIR DERIVATIVES LIKE `git log --grep=`, `git show HEAD`, `git diff --cached`, etc.,. When you want to run these commands, redirect them to a temporary file and open it for reading. For example, `git log --oneline > /backport/tmp/git_log.txt`.",

          "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n  If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n  Then start trying to fix it.\n  When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n  If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n  so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /testbed)\nbash-$",

          "content": "PROBLEM_STATEMENT:\n\nBackport the `original.patch` file to the `code_base` directory. Both the `original.patch` file and the `code_base` directory are available in the current working directory.\nFirst move the `original.patch` file to `/root/original.patch` and then change your working directory to the `code_base` directory by running `cd code_base`. \nNote that ANY Changes outside code_base directory, for instance to the original.patch file, will FAIL the task immediately.\n\nRead the patch file carefully and understand the changes it is making. Then, make the necessary changes in the code base, commit the changes, generate a new patch with `git format-patch -1 HEAD`, and then submit the changes using the `submit <patch_file>` command.\n\nYour git username is `AllSpark` and your email is `allspark@microsoft.com`.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your special-interface terminal session has started. You can use any bash NON-Interactive commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIf exact matches do not exist, use your knowledge of Libsoup commit history to find potential matches based on what files, functions of New Version Map to in the old version.\nNote that these are ONLY POTENTIAL matches, so make sure to verify them by checking the contents of the files and functions. use regex, `find`, `grep`, etc. to further improve your search.\nAlways understand the patch logic, the file content and ensure that the changes you are making are correct & preserve the original patch logic as much as possible.\n\nGENERAL IMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. It is okay to scroll only if you cannot determine the location by other means. Similarly when searching for a function, instead of scrolling down, use the search command to find the function name.\n\n3. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally to write code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it. ALWAYS USE PROPER INDENTATION WHEN EDITING FILES EVEN IF THE SYNTAX IS CORRECT WITHOUT INDENTATION. Code readability is important.\n\n4. Do not try to install any packages with `pip`, `conda`, or any other way. This is NOT ALLOWED. If the environment is not set up correctly, try to fix the issue without executing python code or running any tests that require the package installed. DO NOT Use interactive commands either. You have ONE toolcall per response, and the toolcall should be complete in itself. You wont be able to interact with it.\n\n5. Preserve the comments from the original patch whenever possible. They are important for understanding the code.\n\n6. In case exact matches are unavaialable, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history & New-Code to Old-Code mapping to find potential matches. But always verify your knowledge by checking the contents of the files and functions.\n\n7. You're working on a really big repo. So,  DO NOT use `ls -R` command to list all the files in the repo. Instead, use `find` command to find the files you want to edit. For example, if you want to find a file named `foo.py`, use `find . -name foo.py`.\nAlso make sure you understand interface limitations, OPEN files only, View directories only, etc.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n\n1. You don't need to worry about testing the fix. Try minimal self testing if available. But if it is not available or not running properly, don't worry about it.\n\n2. Read the changes to be applied from the original patch carefully. The `open` command only shows 100 lines, if the patch is longer make sure you scroll down to see the complete file. Make sure you understand all the chunks of the patch that need to be manually applied. Print all the description of changes it does in your thoughts as it will be served to you in the history in future prompts. And start making changes one by one.\n\n3. Locate relevant code using the find and search commands. `open` the file you want to edit. Use these tools most of the time to make yourself familier with the code base. Better understanding is preferred.\n\n4. Your knowlege of libsoup commit history is a powerful tool, list out in thoughts the 'Old-Code' to 'New-Code' mappings and use it to find potential file, function, line numbers.\nThis is NOT absolute, and you must verify your findings by checking the contents of the files and functions.\nTry this only once, and your potential matches not work, use special-interface commands to navigate and find the relevant code.\nAlways prefer codebase search over your knowledge of commit history.\n\n5. Use the `edit` command to perform edits.\n\nTOOL USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. The Tool Command 'OPEN' is ONLY to open files. DO NOT try to OPEN directories, this will FAIL the entire task instantly. Use 'VIEW' command to view directories, and 'OPEN' for files.\nFor example, DO NOT try to OPEN '/swe_repo/code_base/' since it is a directory and this will FAIL the entire task instantly.\n\n2. The file contents are TOO LARGE, if you try to OPEN entire file, it will take up too many tokens. Try to find function names, lines, etc using regex, or ask to cat 10-30 lines of file code at a time.\n\n3. Contents of Directories are TOO LARGE, do not try to use 'ls -R' on them. find specific files. use regex.\n\n4. Interactive Commands like 'vi' DO NOT WORK AT ALL. DO NOT USE THEM. If you try to use them, it will FAIL the entire task instantly. Use Commands like cat to open a file.\n\n5. You can Only Work on libsoup repo. (--code-repo). DO NOT try to open or edit any other files outside this repo. If you try to do so, it will FAIL the entire task instantly.\n   Do NOT in any way change the original patch. You DO NOT have permissions outside the code repo.\n\n(Open file: )\n(Current directory: /swe_repo)\nbash-$",

          "content": "SETTING:\nYou are a software developer with extensive knowledge of Libsoup Package, and its commit history.\n\nYour primary job is to backport a patch written for LATEST version of Libsoup, into the OLD version of Libsoup.\n\nFor this, you will be given a specially designed command line interface. THIS is NOT the standard command line interface.\nThis interface has its own Rules & limitations, work IN THOSE LIMITATIONS Only.\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you 100 lines of a file at a time.\nThe special interface DOES NOT allow any interactive commands like `vi`. Non interactive commands like `cat`, `find`, `grep`, etc are allowed.\nAlso, it has some specific commands with PROPER LIMITATIONS: (like `OPEN` (File ONLY), `VIEW` (Directory ONLY) etc.)\n\nTo backport the patch, DO NOT Try to Cherrypick.\nApply the patch MANUALLY.\n\nFirst, read the full patch and understand the changes in the patch.\nThen, find what files, functions are being changed.\nThen, locate those files and functions in the OLD code base.\n\nIf you cannot find an exact match, use your knowledge of Libsoup COMMIT HISTORY.\nMention what files, functions in the LATEST version map to what files, functions in the OLD version.\nThen based on this, mention potential filenames, functionnames that the Latest patch might be referring to in the Old code base.\n\nThen, use the special interface to search the codebase and make corresponding changes to the codebase based on the patch.\nuse commands like `find`, `goto`, `grep`, etc. to find the relevant code in the OLD code base and backport the patch.\nuse regex to find filenames/paths, function names, etc. in case exact matches are not found.\n\nExample:\nif the Patch changes `src/lib/soup-foo.c` file,\n1. First, try to find the exact file in the OLD code base.\n2. If you cannot find the exact file, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history, to map filename of `src/lib/soup-foo.c` in the LATEST version to filename in the OLD version.\n3. if you still cannot find the exact file, try to find potential filenames using regex search or searching contents of file.\n4. Always check your findings with your knowledge of libsoup commit history, and ensure that file you found is indeed the correct file.\n\nExample:\nif the Patch changes a function named `soup_foo_bar()` in `src/soup_decoder/is-bar.c` file,\n1. First, try to find the exact function in the OLD code base.\n2. If you cannot find the exact function, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history, to map function name of `soup_foo_bar()` in the LATEST version to OLD version.\nfor example, it might be named `soup_foo_bar_v2()` in the OLD version, or it might have been moved to some other file, or broken into multiple functions, etc.\nbased on this, make a list of potential matches.\n\nTry to PRESERVE the original patch as much as possible, including comments and formatting.\nYou will be penalized for changes that deviate from the patch logic unnecessarily.\n\nMake sure that all your search, edits are within the `--code-base` directory.\nAny changes outside this directory will FAIL the task immediately.\n\nThe files & directories are very large.\nif you try to open a very large file, or list a very large directory, it will take up too many tokens and you will be penalized.\nSo, use commands like `find`, `grep`, etc. to locate files and functions and then use commands like `goto` to jump to specific lines.\n\nTo navigate/edit the codebase using the special interface, invoke the interface with a function call/tool call.\n\nGive special importance to the indentation and whitespaces in the code which are related to syntax.\nFor example, if you are looking at this file:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello world\")\n\nand you want to edit the file to read:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello\")\n    print(\"world\")\n\nyour search string should be `Hello world` and your replace string should be `\"Hello\"\\n    print(\"world\")`\n(note the extra spaces before the print statement!).\nYou could also get the same result by search for `    print(\"Hello world\")` and replace with `    print(\"Hello\")\\n    print(\"world\")`.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>)\n(Current directory: <cwd>)\nbash-$\n\nFirst, you should ALWAYS include a general thought about what you're going to do next.\nThe thought should either be based on Last Observation or Your Libsoup Commit History knowledge.\nThen, for every response, you must include exactly ONE tool call/function call.\n\nNote that the special interface DOES NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them. Any command that require interactive session like \"git show\", \"git log\", etc., will not work. So, DON'T USE ANY INTERACTIVE SESSION COMMANDS OR THEIR DERIVATIVES LIKE `git log --grep=`, `git show HEAD`, `git diff --cached`, etc.,. When you want to run these commands, redirect them to a temporary file and open it for reading. For example, `git log --oneline > /backport/tmp/git_log.txt`.",

          "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n  If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n  Then start trying to fix it.\n  When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n  If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n  so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /testbed)\nbash-$",

          "content": "PROBLEM_STATEMENT:\n\nBackport the `original.patch` file to the `code_base` directory. Both the `original.patch` file and the `code_base` directory are available in the current working directory.\nFirst move the `original.patch` file to `/root/original.patch` and then change your working directory to the `code_base` directory by running `cd code_base`. \nNote that ANY Changes outside code_base directory, for instance to the original.patch file, will FAIL the task immediately.\n\nRead the patch file carefully and understand the changes it is making. Then, make the necessary changes in the code base, commit the changes, generate a new patch with `git format-patch -1 HEAD`, and then submit the changes using the `submit <patch_file>` command.\n\nYour git username is `AllSpark` and your email is `allspark@microsoft.com`.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your special-interface terminal session has started. You can use any bash NON-Interactive commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIf exact matches do not exist, use your knowledge of Libsoup commit history to find potential matches based on what files, functions of New Version Map to in the old version.\nNote that these are ONLY POTENTIAL matches, so make sure to verify them by checking the contents of the files and functions. use regex, `find`, `grep`, etc. to further improve your search.\nAlways understand the patch logic, the file content and ensure that the changes you are making are correct & preserve the original patch logic as much as possible.\n\nGENERAL IMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. It is okay to scroll only if you cannot determine the location by other means. Similarly when searching for a function, instead of scrolling down, use the search command to find the function name.\n\n3. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally to write code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it. ALWAYS USE PROPER INDENTATION WHEN EDITING FILES EVEN IF THE SYNTAX IS CORRECT WITHOUT INDENTATION. Code readability is important.\n\n4. Do not try to install any packages with `pip`, `conda`, or any other way. This is NOT ALLOWED. If the environment is not set up correctly, try to fix the issue without executing python code or running any tests that require the package installed. DO NOT Use interactive commands either. You have ONE toolcall per response, and the toolcall should be complete in itself. You wont be able to interact with it.\n\n5. Preserve the comments from the original patch whenever possible. They are important for understanding the code.\n\n6. In case exact matches are unavaialable, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history & New-Code to Old-Code mapping to find potential matches. But always verify your knowledge by checking the contents of the files and functions.\n\n7. You're working on a really big repo. So,  DO NOT use `ls -R` command to list all the files in the repo. Instead, use `find` command to find the files you want to edit. For example, if you want to find a file named `foo.py`, use `find . -name foo.py`.\nAlso make sure you understand interface limitations, OPEN files only, View directories only, etc.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n\n1. You don't need to worry about testing the fix. Try minimal self testing if available. But if it is not available or not running properly, don't worry about it.\n\n2. Read the changes to be applied from the original patch carefully. The `open` command only shows 100 lines, if the patch is longer make sure you scroll down to see the complete file. Make sure you understand all the chunks of the patch that need to be manually applied. Print all the description of changes it does in your thoughts as it will be served to you in the history in future prompts. And start making changes one by one.\n\n3. Locate relevant code using the find and search commands. `open` the file you want to edit. Use these tools most of the time to make yourself familier with the code base. Better understanding is preferred.\n\n4. Your knowlege of libsoup commit history is a powerful tool, list out in thoughts the 'Old-Code' to 'New-Code' mappings and use it to find potential file, function, line numbers.\nThis is NOT absolute, and you must verify your findings by checking the contents of the files and functions.\nTry this only once, and your potential matches not work, use special-interface commands to navigate and find the relevant code.\nAlways prefer codebase search over your knowledge of commit history.\n\n5. Use the `edit` command to perform edits.\n\nTOOL USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. The Tool Command 'OPEN' is ONLY to open files. DO NOT try to OPEN directories, this will FAIL the entire task instantly. Use 'VIEW' command to view directories, and 'OPEN' for files.\nFor example, DO NOT try to OPEN '/swe_repo/code_base/' since it is a directory and this will FAIL the entire task instantly.\n\n2. The file contents are TOO LARGE, if you try to OPEN entire file, it will take up too many tokens. Try to find function names, lines, etc using regex, or ask to cat 10-30 lines of file code at a time.\n\n3. Contents of Directories are TOO LARGE, do not try to use 'ls -R' on them. find specific files. use regex.\n\n4. Interactive Commands like 'vi' DO NOT WORK AT ALL. DO NOT USE THEM. If you try to use them, it will FAIL the entire task instantly. Use Commands like cat to open a file.\n\n5. You can Only Work on libsoup repo. (--code-repo). DO NOT try to open or edit any other files outside this repo. If you try to do so, it will FAIL the entire task instantly.\n   Do NOT in any way change the original patch. You DO NOT have permissions outside the code repo.\n\n(Open file: )\n(Current directory: /swe_repo)\nbash-$",

          "content": "SETTING:\nYou are a software developer with extensive knowledge of Libsoup Package, and its commit history.\n\nYour primary job is to backport a patch written for LATEST version of Libsoup, into the OLD version of Libsoup.\n\nFor this, you will be given a specially designed command line interface. THIS is NOT the standard command line interface.\nThis interface has its own Rules & limitations, work IN THOSE LIMITATIONS Only.\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you 100 lines of a file at a time.\nThe special interface DOES NOT allow any interactive commands like `vi`. Non interactive commands like `cat`, `find`, `grep`, etc are allowed.\nAlso, it has some specific commands with PROPER LIMITATIONS: (like `OPEN` (File ONLY), `VIEW` (Directory ONLY) etc.)\n\nTo backport the patch, DO NOT Try to Cherrypick.\nApply the patch MANUALLY.\n\nFirst, read the full patch and understand the changes in the patch.\nThen, find what files, functions are being changed.\nThen, locate those files and functions in the OLD code base.\n\nIf you cannot find an exact match, use your knowledge of Libsoup COMMIT HISTORY.\nMention what files, functions in the LATEST version map to what files, functions in the OLD version.\nThen based on this, mention potential filenames, functionnames that the Latest patch might be referring to in the Old code base.\n\nThen, use the special interface to search the codebase and make corresponding changes to the codebase based on the patch.\nuse commands like `find`, `goto`, `grep`, etc. to find the relevant code in the OLD code base and backport the patch.\nuse regex to find filenames/paths, function names, etc. in case exact matches are not found.\n\nExample:\nif the Patch changes `src/lib/soup-foo.c` file,\n1. First, try to find the exact file in the OLD code base.\n2. If you cannot find the exact file, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history, to map filename of `src/lib/soup-foo.c` in the LATEST version to filename in the OLD version.\n3. if you still cannot find the exact file, try to find potential filenames using regex search or searching contents of file.\n4. Always check your findings with your knowledge of libsoup commit history, and ensure that file you found is indeed the correct file.\n\nExample:\nif the Patch changes a function named `soup_foo_bar()` in `src/soup_decoder/is-bar.c` file,\n1. First, try to find the exact function in the OLD code base.\n2. If you cannot find the exact function, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history, to map function name of `soup_foo_bar()` in the LATEST version to OLD version.\nfor example, it might be named `soup_foo_bar_v2()` in the OLD version, or it might have been moved to some other file, or broken into multiple functions, etc.\nbased on this, make a list of potential matches.\n\nTry to PRESERVE the original patch as much as possible, including comments and formatting.\nYou will be penalized for changes that deviate from the patch logic unnecessarily.\n\nMake sure that all your search, edits are within the `--code-base` directory.\nAny changes outside this directory will FAIL the task immediately.\n\nThe files & directories are very large.\nif you try to open a very large file, or list a very large directory, it will take up too many tokens and you will be penalized.\nSo, use commands like `find`, `grep`, etc. to locate files and functions and then use commands like `goto` to jump to specific lines.\n\nTo navigate/edit the codebase using the special interface, invoke the interface with a function call/tool call.\n\nGive special importance to the indentation and whitespaces in the code which are related to syntax.\nFor example, if you are looking at this file:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello world\")\n\nand you want to edit the file to read:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello\")\n    print(\"world\")\n\nyour search string should be `Hello world` and your replace string should be `\"Hello\"\\n    print(\"world\")`\n(note the extra spaces before the print statement!).\nYou could also get the same result by search for `    print(\"Hello world\")` and replace with `    print(\"Hello\")\\n    print(\"world\")`.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>)\n(Current directory: <cwd>)\nbash-$\n\nFirst, you should ALWAYS include a general thought about what you're going to do next.\nThe thought should either be based on Last Observation or Your Libsoup Commit History knowledge.\nThen, for every response, you must include exactly ONE tool call/function call.\n\nNote that the special interface DOES NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them. Any command that require interactive session like \"git show\", \"git log\", etc., will not work. So, DON'T USE ANY INTERACTIVE SESSION COMMANDS OR THEIR DERIVATIVES LIKE `git log --grep=`, `git show HEAD`, `git diff --cached`, etc.,. When you want to run these commands, redirect them to a temporary file and open it for reading. For example, `git log --oneline > /backport/tmp/git_log.txt`.",

          "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n  If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n  Then start trying to fix it.\n  When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n  If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n  so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /testbed)\nbash-$",

Both the `original.patch` file and the `code_base` directory are available in the current working directory.\nFirst move the `original.patch` file to `/root/original.patch` and then change your working directory to the `code_base` directory by running `cd code_base`. \nNote that ANY Changes outside code_base directory, for instance to the original.patch file, will FAIL the task immediately.\n\nRead the patch file carefully and understand the changes it is making. Then, make the necessary changes in the code base, commit the changes, generate a new patch with `git format-patch -1 HEAD`, and then submit the changes using the `submit <patch_file>` command.\n\nYour git username is `AllSpark` and your email is `allspark@microsoft.com`.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your special-interface terminal session has started. You can use any bash NON-Interactive commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIf exact matches do not exist, use your knowledge of Libsoup commit history to find potential matches based on what files, functions of New Version Map to in the old version.\nNote that these are ONLY POTENTIAL matches, so make sure to verify them by checking the contents of the files and functions. use regex, `find`, `grep`, etc. to further improve your search.\nAlways understand the patch logic, the file content and ensure that the changes you are making are correct & preserve the original patch logic as much as possible.\n\nGENERAL IMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. It is okay to scroll only if you cannot determine the location by other means. Similarly when searching for a function, instead of scrolling down, use the search command to find the function name.\n\n3. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally to write code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it. ALWAYS USE PROPER INDENTATION WHEN EDITING FILES EVEN IF THE SYNTAX IS CORRECT WITHOUT INDENTATION. Code readability is important.\n\n4. Do not try to install any packages with `pip`, `conda`, or any other way. This is NOT ALLOWED. If the environment is not set up correctly, try to fix the issue without executing python code or running any tests that require the package installed. DO NOT Use interactive commands either. You have ONE toolcall per response, and the toolcall should be complete in itself. You wont be able to interact with it.\n\n5. Preserve the comments from the original patch whenever possible. They are important for understanding the code.\n\n6. In case exact matches are unavaialable, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history & New-Code to Old-Code mapping to find potential matches. But always verify your knowledge by checking the contents of the files and functions.\n\n7. You're working on a really big repo. So,  DO NOT use `ls -R` command to list all the files in the repo. Instead, use `find` command to find the files you want to edit. For example, if you want to find a file named `foo.py`, use `find . -name foo.py`.\nAlso make sure you understand interface limitations, OPEN files only, View directories only, etc.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n\n1. You don't need to worry about testing the fix. Try minimal self testing if available. But if it is not available or not running properly, don't worry about it.\n\n2. Read the changes to be applied from the original patch carefully. The `open` command only shows 100 lines, if the patch is longer make sure you scroll down to see the complete file. Make sure you understand all the chunks of the patch that need to be manually applied. Print all the description of changes it does in your thoughts as it will be served to you in the history in future prompts. And start making changes one by one.\n\n3. Locate relevant code using the find and search commands. `open` the file you want to edit. Use these tools most of the time to make yourself familier with the code base. Better understanding is preferred.\n\n4. Your knowlege of libsoup commit history is a powerful tool, list out in thoughts the 'Old-Code' to 'New-Code' mappings and use it to find potential file, function, line numbers.\nThis is NOT absolute, and you must verify your findings by checking the contents of the files and functions.\nTry this only once, and your potential matches not work, use special-interface commands to navigate and find the relevant code.\nAlways prefer codebase search over your knowledge of commit history.\n\n5. Use the `edit` command to perform edits.\n\nTOOL USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. The Tool Command 'OPEN' is ONLY to open files. DO NOT try to OPEN directories, this will FAIL the entire task instantly. Use 'VIEW' command to view directories, and 'OPEN' for files.\nFor example, DO NOT try to OPEN '/swe_repo/code_base/' since it is a directory and this will FAIL the entire task instantly.\n\n2. The file contents are TOO LARGE, if you try to OPEN entire file, it will take up too many tokens. Try to find function names, lines, etc using regex, or ask to cat 10-30 lines of file code at a time.\n\n3.

THIS is NOT the standard command line interface.\nThis interface has its own Rules & limitations, work IN THOSE LIMITATIONS Only.\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you 100 lines of a file at a time.\nThe special interface DOES NOT allow any interactive commands like `vi`. Non interactive commands like `cat`, `find`, `grep`, etc are allowed.\nAlso, it has some specific commands with PROPER LIMITATIONS: (like `OPEN` (File ONLY), `VIEW` (Directory ONLY) etc.)\n\nTo backport the patch, DO NOT Try to Cherrypick.\nApply the patch MANUALLY.\n\nFirst, read the full patch and understand the changes in the patch.\nThen, find what files, functions are being changed.\nThen, locate those files and functions in the OLD code base.\n\nIf you cannot find an exact match, use your knowledge of Libsoup COMMIT HISTORY.\nMention what files, functions in the LATEST version map to what files, functions in the OLD version.\nThen based on this, mention potential filenames, functionnames that the Latest patch might be referring to in the Old code base.\n\nThen, use the special interface to search the codebase and make corresponding changes to the codebase based on the patch.\nuse commands like `find`, `goto`, `grep`, etc. to find the relevant code in the OLD code base and backport the patch.\nuse regex to find filenames/paths, function names, etc. in case exact matches are not found.\n\nExample:\nif the Patch changes `src/lib/soup-foo.c` file,\n1. First, try to find the exact file in the OLD code base.\n2. If you cannot find the exact file, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history, to map filename of `src/lib/soup-foo.c` in the LATEST version to filename in the OLD version.\n3. if you still cannot find the exact file, try to find potential filenames using regex search or searching contents of file.\n4. Always check your findings with your knowledge of libsoup commit history, and ensure that file you found is indeed the correct file.\n\nExample:\nif the Patch changes a function named `soup_foo_bar()` in `src/soup_decoder/is-bar.c` file,\n1. First, try to find the exact function in the OLD code base.\n2. If you cannot find the exact function, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history, to map function name of `soup_foo_bar()` in the LATEST version to OLD version.\nfor example, it might be named `soup_foo_bar_v2()` in the OLD version, or it might have been moved to some other file, or broken into multiple functions, etc.\nbased on this, make a list of potential matches.\n\nTry to PRESERVE the original patch as much as possible, including comments and formatting.\nYou will be penalized for changes that deviate from the patch logic unnecessarily.\n\nMake sure that all your search, edits are within the `--code-base` directory.\nAny changes outside this directory will FAIL the task immediately.\n\nThe files & directories are very large.\nif you try to open a very large file, or list a very large directory, it will take up too many tokens and you will be penalized.\nSo, use commands like `find`, `grep`, etc. to locate files and functions and then use commands like `goto` to jump to specific lines.\n\nTo navigate/edit the codebase using the special interface, invoke the interface with a function call/tool call.\n\nGive special importance to the indentation and whitespaces in the code which are related to syntax.\nFor example, if you are looking at this file:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello world\")\n\nand you want to edit the file to read:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello\")\n    print(\"world\")\n\nyour search string should be `Hello world` and your replace string should be `\"Hello\"\\n    print(\"world\")`\n(note the extra spaces before the print statement!).\nYou could also get the same result by search for `    print(\"Hello world\")` and replace with `    print(\"Hello\")\\n    print(\"world\")`.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>)\n(Current directory: <cwd>)\nbash-$\n\nFirst, you should ALWAYS include a general thought about what you're going to do next.\nThe thought should either be based on Last Observation or Your Libsoup Commit History knowledge.\nThen, for every response, you must include exactly ONE tool call/function call.\n\nNote that the special interface DOES NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them. Any command that require interactive session like \"git show\", \"git log\", etc., will not work. So, DON'T USE ANY INTERACTIVE SESSION COMMANDS OR THEIR DERIVATIVES LIKE `git log --grep=`, `git show HEAD`, `git diff --cached`, etc.,. When you want to run these commands, redirect them to a temporary file and open it for reading. For example, `git log --oneline > /backport/tmp/git_log.txt`.",

          "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n  If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n  Then start trying to fix it.\n  When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n  If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n  so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /testbed)\nbash-$",

Both the `original.patch` file and the `code_base` directory are available in the current working directory.\nFirst move the `original.patch` file to `/root/original.patch` and then change your working directory to the `code_base` directory by running `cd code_base`. \nNote that ANY Changes outside code_base directory, for instance to the original.patch file, will FAIL the task immediately.\n\nRead the patch file carefully and understand the changes it is making. Then, make the necessary changes in the code base, commit the changes, generate a new patch with `git format-patch -1 HEAD`, and then submit the changes using the `submit <patch_file>` command.\n\nYour git username is `AllSpark` and your email is `allspark@microsoft.com`.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your special-interface terminal session has started. You can use any bash NON-Interactive commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIf exact matches do not exist, use your knowledge of Libsoup commit history to find potential matches based on what files, functions of New Version Map to in the old version.\nNote that these are ONLY POTENTIAL matches, so make sure to verify them by checking the contents of the files and functions. use regex, `find`, `grep`, etc. to further improve your search.\nAlways understand the patch logic, the file content and ensure that the changes you are making are correct & preserve the original patch logic as much as possible.\n\nGENERAL IMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. It is okay to scroll only if you cannot determine the location by other means. Similarly when searching for a function, instead of scrolling down, use the search command to find the function name.\n\n3. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally to write code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it. ALWAYS USE PROPER INDENTATION WHEN EDITING FILES EVEN IF THE SYNTAX IS CORRECT WITHOUT INDENTATION. Code readability is important.\n\n4. Do not try to install any packages with `pip`, `conda`, or any other way. This is NOT ALLOWED. If the environment is not set up correctly, try to fix the issue without executing python code or running any tests that require the package installed. DO NOT Use interactive commands either. You have ONE toolcall per response, and the toolcall should be complete in itself. You wont be able to interact with it.\n\n5. Preserve the comments from the original patch whenever possible. They are important for understanding the code.\n\n6. In case exact matches are unavaialable, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history & New-Code to Old-Code mapping to find potential matches. But always verify your knowledge by checking the contents of the files and functions.\n\n7. You're working on a really big repo. So,  DO NOT use `ls -R` command to list all the files in the repo. Instead, use `find` command to find the files you want to edit. For example, if you want to find a file named `foo.py`, use `find . -name foo.py`.\nAlso make sure you understand interface limitations, OPEN files only, View directories only, etc.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n\n1. You don't need to worry about testing the fix. Try minimal self testing if available. But if it is not available or not running properly, don't worry about it.\n\n2. Read the changes to be applied from the original patch carefully. The `open` command only shows 100 lines, if the patch is longer make sure you scroll down to see the complete file. Make sure you understand all the chunks of the patch that need to be manually applied. Print all the description of changes it does in your thoughts as it will be served to you in the history in future prompts. And start making changes one by one.\n\n3. Locate relevant code using the find and search commands. `open` the file you want to edit. Use these tools most of the time to make yourself familier with the code base. Better understanding is preferred.\n\n4. Your knowlege of libsoup commit history is a powerful tool, list out in thoughts the 'Old-Code' to 'New-Code' mappings and use it to find potential file, function, line numbers.\nThis is NOT absolute, and you must verify your findings by checking the contents of the files and functions.\nTry this only once, and your potential matches not work, use special-interface commands to navigate and find the relevant code.\nAlways prefer codebase search over your knowledge of commit history.\n\n5. Use the `edit` command to perform edits.\n\nTOOL USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. The Tool Command 'OPEN' is ONLY to open files. DO NOT try to OPEN directories, this will FAIL the entire task instantly. Use 'VIEW' command to view directories, and 'OPEN' for files.\nFor example, DO NOT try to OPEN '/swe_repo/code_base/' since it is a directory and this will FAIL the entire task instantly.\n\n2. The file contents are TOO LARGE, if you try to OPEN entire file, it will take up too many tokens. Try to find function names, lines, etc using regex, or ask to cat 10-30 lines of file code at a time.\n\n3. Contents of Directories are TOO LARGE, do not try to use 'ls -R' on them. find specific files. use regex.\n\n4. Interactive Commands like 'vi' DO NOT WORK AT ALL. DO NOT USE THEM. If you try to use them, it will FAIL the entire task instantly. Use Commands like cat to open a file.\n\n5. You can Only Work on libsoup repo. (--code-repo). DO NOT try to open or edit any other files outside this repo. If you try to do so, it will FAIL the entire task instantly.\n   Do NOT in any way change the original patch. You DO NOT have permissions outside the code repo.\n\n(Open file: )\n(Current directory: /swe_repo)\nbash-$",

THIS is NOT the standard command line interface.\nThis interface has its own Rules & limitations, work IN THOSE LIMITATIONS Only.\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you 100 lines of a file at a time.\nThe special interface DOES NOT allow any interactive commands like `vi`. Non interactive commands like `cat`, `find`, `grep`, etc are allowed.\nAlso, it has some specific commands with PROPER LIMITATIONS: (like `OPEN` (File ONLY), `VIEW` (Directory ONLY) etc.)\n\nTo backport the patch, DO NOT Try to Cherrypick.\nApply the patch MANUALLY.\n\nFirst, read the full patch and understand the changes in the patch.\nThen, find what files, functions are being changed.\nThen, locate those files and functions in the OLD code base.\n\nIf you cannot find an exact match, use your knowledge of Libsoup COMMIT HISTORY.\nMention what files, functions in the LATEST version map to what files, functions in the OLD version.\nThen based on this, mention potential filenames, functionnames that the Latest patch might be referring to in the Old code base.\n\nThen, use the special interface to search the codebase and make corresponding changes to the codebase based on the patch.\nuse commands like `find`, `goto`, `grep`, etc. to find the relevant code in the OLD code base and backport the patch.\nuse regex to find filenames/paths, function names, etc. in case exact matches are not found.\n\nExample:\nif the Patch changes `src/lib/soup-foo.c` file,\n1. First, try to find the exact file in the OLD code base.\n2. If you cannot find the exact file, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history, to map filename of `src/lib/soup-foo.c` in the LATEST version to filename in the OLD version.\n3. if you still cannot find the exact file, try to find potential filenames using regex search or searching contents of file.\n4. Always check your findings with your knowledge of libsoup commit history, and ensure that file you found is indeed the correct file.\n\nExample:\nif the Patch changes a function named `soup_foo_bar()` in `src/soup_decoder/is-bar.c` file,\n1. First, try to find the exact function in the OLD code base.\n2. If you cannot find the exact function, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history, to map function name of `soup_foo_bar()` in the LATEST version to OLD version.\nfor example, it might be named `soup_foo_bar_v2()` in the OLD version, or it might have been moved to some other file, or broken into multiple functions, etc.\nbased on this, make a list of potential matches.\n\nTry to PRESERVE the original patch as much as possible, including comments and formatting.\nYou will be penalized for changes that deviate from the patch logic unnecessarily.\n\nMake sure that all your search, edits are within the `--code-base` directory.\nAny changes outside this directory will FAIL the task immediately.\n\nThe files & directories are very large.\nif you try to open a very large file, or list a very large directory, it will take up too many tokens and you will be penalized.\nSo, use commands like `find`, `grep`, etc. to locate files and functions and then use commands like `goto` to jump to specific lines.\n\nTo navigate/edit the codebase using the special interface, invoke the interface with a function call/tool call.\n\nGive special importance to the indentation and whitespaces in the code which are related to syntax.\nFor example, if you are looking at this file:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello world\")\n\nand you want to edit the file to read:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello\")\n    print(\"world\")\n\nyour search string should be `Hello world` and your replace string should be `\"Hello\"\\n    print(\"world\")`\n(note the extra spaces before the print statement!).\nYou could also get the same result by search for `    print(\"Hello world\")` and replace with `    print(\"Hello\")\\n    print(\"world\")`.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>)\n(Current directory: <cwd>)\nbash-$\n\nFirst, you should ALWAYS include a general thought about what you're going to do next.\nThe thought should either be based on Last Observation or Your Libsoup Commit History knowledge.\nThen, for every response, you must include exactly ONE tool call/function call.\n\nNote that the special interface DOES NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them. Any command that require interactive session like \"git show\", \"git log\", etc., will not work. So, DON'T USE ANY INTERACTIVE SESSION COMMANDS OR THEIR DERIVATIVES LIKE `git log --grep=`, `git show HEAD`, `git diff --cached`, etc.,. When you want to run these commands, redirect them to a temporary file and open it for reading. For example, `git log --oneline > /backport/tmp/git_log.txt`.",

          "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n  If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n  Then start trying to fix it.\n  When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n  If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n  so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /testbed)\nbash-$",

          "content": "PROBLEM_STATEMENT:\n\nBackport the `original.patch` file to the `code_base` directory. Both the `original.patch` file and the `code_base` directory are available in the current working directory.\nFirst move the `original.patch` file to `/root/original.patch` and then change your working directory to the `code_base` directory by running `cd code_base`. \nNote that ANY Changes outside code_base directory, for instance to the original.patch file, will FAIL the task immediately.\n\nRead the patch file carefully and understand the changes it is making. Then, make the necessary changes in the code base, commit the changes, generate a new patch with `git format-patch -1 HEAD`, and then submit the changes using the `submit <patch_file>` command.\n\nYour git username is `AllSpark` and your email is `allspark@microsoft.com`.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your special-interface terminal session has started. You can use any bash NON-Interactive commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIf exact matches do not exist, use your knowledge of Libsoup commit history to find potential matches based on what files, functions of New Version Map to in the old version.\nNote that these are ONLY POTENTIAL matches, so make sure to verify them by checking the contents of the files and functions. use regex, `find`, `grep`, etc. to further improve your search.\nAlways understand the patch logic, the file content and ensure that the changes you are making are correct & preserve the original patch logic as much as possible.\n\nGENERAL IMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. It is okay to scroll only if you cannot determine the location by other means. Similarly when searching for a function, instead of scrolling down, use the search command to find the function name.\n\n3. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally to write code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it. ALWAYS USE PROPER INDENTATION WHEN EDITING FILES EVEN IF THE SYNTAX IS CORRECT WITHOUT INDENTATION. Code readability is important.\n\n4. Do not try to install any packages with `pip`, `conda`, or any other way. This is NOT ALLOWED. If the environment is not set up correctly, try to fix the issue without executing python code or running any tests that require the package installed. DO NOT Use interactive commands either. You have ONE toolcall per response, and the toolcall should be complete in itself. You wont be able to interact with it.\n\n5. Preserve the comments from the original patch whenever possible. They are important for understanding the code.\n\n6. In case exact matches are unavaialable, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history & New-Code to Old-Code mapping to find potential matches. But always verify your knowledge by checking the contents of the files and functions.\n\n7. You're working on a really big repo. So,  DO NOT use `ls -R` command to list all the files in the repo. Instead, use `find` command to find the files you want to edit. For example, if you want to find a file named `foo.py`, use `find . -name foo.py`.\nAlso make sure you understand interface limitations, OPEN files only, View directories only, etc.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n\n1. You don't need to worry about testing the fix. Try minimal self testing if available. But if it is not available or not running properly, don't worry about it.\n\n2. Read the changes to be applied from the original patch carefully. The `open` command only shows 100 lines, if the patch is longer make sure you scroll down to see the complete file. Make sure you understand all the chunks of the patch that need to be manually applied. Print all the description of changes it does in your thoughts as it will be served to you in the history in future prompts. And start making changes one by one.\n\n3. Locate relevant code using the find and search commands. `open` the file you want to edit. Use these tools most of the time to make yourself familier with the code base. Better understanding is preferred.\n\n4. Your knowlege of libsoup commit history is a powerful tool, list out in thoughts the 'Old-Code' to 'New-Code' mappings and use it to find potential file, function, line numbers.\nThis is NOT absolute, and you must verify your findings by checking the contents of the files and functions.\nTry this only once, and your potential matches not work, use special-interface commands to navigate and find the relevant code.\nAlways prefer codebase search over your knowledge of commit history.\n\n5. Use the `edit` command to perform edits.\n\nTOOL USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. The Tool Command 'OPEN' is ONLY to open files. DO NOT try to OPEN directories, this will FAIL the entire task instantly. Use 'VIEW' command to view directories, and 'OPEN' for files.\nFor example, DO NOT try to OPEN '/swe_repo/code_base/' since it is a directory and this will FAIL the entire task instantly.\n\n2. The file contents are TOO LARGE, if you try to OPEN entire file, it will take up too many tokens. Try to find function names, lines, etc using regex, or ask to cat 10-30 lines of file code at a time.\n\n3. Contents of Directories are TOO LARGE, do not try to use 'ls -R' on them. find specific files. use regex.\n\n4. Interactive Commands like 'vi' DO NOT WORK AT ALL. DO NOT USE THEM. If you try to use them, it will FAIL the entire task instantly. Use Commands like cat to open a file.\n\n5. You can Only Work on libsoup repo. (--code-repo). DO NOT try to open or edit any other files outside this repo. If you try to do so, it will FAIL the entire task instantly.\n   Do NOT in any way change the original patch. You DO NOT have permissions outside the code repo.\n\n(Open file: )\n(Current directory: /swe_repo)\nbash-$",

THIS is NOT the standard command line interface.\nThis interface has its own Rules & limitations, work IN THOSE LIMITATIONS Only.\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you 100 lines of a file at a time.\nThe special interface DOES NOT allow any interactive commands like `vi`. Non interactive commands like `cat`, `find`, `grep`, etc are allowed.\nAlso, it has some specific commands with PROPER LIMITATIONS: (like `OPEN` (File ONLY), `VIEW` (Directory ONLY) etc.)\n\nTo backport the patch, DO NOT Try to Cherrypick.\nApply the patch MANUALLY.\n\nFirst, read the full patch and understand the changes in the patch.\nThen, find what files, functions are being changed.\nThen, locate those files and functions in the OLD code base.\n\nIf you cannot find an exact match, use your knowledge of Libsoup COMMIT HISTORY.\nMention what files, functions in the LATEST version map to what files, functions in the OLD version.\nThen based on this, mention potential filenames, functionnames that the Latest patch might be referring to in the Old code base.\n\nThen, use the special interface to search the codebase and make corresponding changes to the codebase based on the patch.\nuse commands like `find`, `goto`, `grep`, etc. to find the relevant code in the OLD code base and backport the patch.\nuse regex to find filenames/paths, function names, etc. in case exact matches are not found.\n\nExample:\nif the Patch changes `src/lib/soup-foo.c` file,\n1. First, try to find the exact file in the OLD code base.\n2. If you cannot find the exact file, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history, to map filename of `src/lib/soup-foo.c` in the LATEST version to filename in the OLD version.\n3. if you still cannot find the exact file, try to find potential filenames using regex search or searching contents of file.\n4. Always check your findings with your knowledge of libsoup commit history, and ensure that file you found is indeed the correct file.\n\nExample:\nif the Patch changes a function named `soup_foo_bar()` in `src/soup_decoder/is-bar.c` file,\n1. First, try to find the exact function in the OLD code base.\n2. If you cannot find the exact function, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history, to map function name of `soup_foo_bar()` in the LATEST version to OLD version.\nfor example, it might be named `soup_foo_bar_v2()` in the OLD version, or it might have been moved to some other file, or broken into multiple functions, etc.\nbased on this, make a list of potential matches.\n\nTry to PRESERVE the original patch as much as possible, including comments and formatting.\nYou will be penalized for changes that deviate from the patch logic unnecessarily.\n\nMake sure that all your search, edits are within the `--code-base` directory.\nAny changes outside this directory will FAIL the task immediately.\n\nThe files & directories are very large.\nif you try to open a very large file, or list a very large directory, it will take up too many tokens and you will be penalized.\nSo, use commands like `find`, `grep`, etc. to locate files and functions and then use commands like `goto` to jump to specific lines.\n\nTo navigate/edit the codebase using the special interface, invoke the interface with a function call/tool call.\n\nGive special importance to the indentation and whitespaces in the code which are related to syntax.\nFor example, if you are looking at this file:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello world\")\n\nand you want to edit the file to read:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello\")\n    print(\"world\")\n\nyour search string should be `Hello world` and your replace string should be `\"Hello\"\\n    print(\"world\")`\n(note the extra spaces before the print statement!).\nYou could also get the same result by search for `    print(\"Hello world\")` and replace with `    print(\"Hello\")\\n    print(\"world\")`.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>)\n(Current directory: <cwd>)\nbash-$\n\nFirst, you should ALWAYS include a general thought about what you're going to do next.\nThe thought should either be based on Last Observation or Your Libsoup Commit History knowledge.\nThen, for every response, you must include exactly ONE tool call/function call.\n\nNote that the special interface DOES NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them. Any command that require interactive session like \"git show\", \"git log\", etc., will not work. So, DON'T USE ANY INTERACTIVE SESSION COMMANDS OR THEIR DERIVATIVES LIKE `git log --grep=`, `git show HEAD`, `git diff --cached`, etc.,. When you want to run these commands, redirect them to a temporary file and open it for reading. For example, `git log --oneline > /backport/tmp/git_log.txt`.",

          "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n  If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n  Then start trying to fix it.\n  When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n  If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n  so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /testbed)\nbash-$",

          "content": "PROBLEM_STATEMENT:\n\nBackport the `original.patch` file to the `code_base` directory. Both the `original.patch` file and the `code_base` directory are available in the current working directory.\nFirst move the `original.patch` file to `/root/original.patch` and then change your working directory to the `code_base` directory by running `cd code_base`. \nNote that ANY Changes outside code_base directory, for instance to the original.patch file, will FAIL the task immediately.\n\nRead the patch file carefully and understand the changes it is making. Then, make the necessary changes in the code base, commit the changes, generate a new patch with `git format-patch -1 HEAD`, and then submit the changes using the `submit <patch_file>` command.\n\nYour git username is `AllSpark` and your email is `allspark@microsoft.com`.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your special-interface terminal session has started. You can use any bash NON-Interactive commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIf exact matches do not exist, use your knowledge of Libsoup commit history to find potential matches based on what files, functions of New Version Map to in the old version.\nNote that these are ONLY POTENTIAL matches, so make sure to verify them by checking the contents of the files and functions. use regex, `find`, `grep`, etc. to further improve your search.\nAlways understand the patch logic, the file content and ensure that the changes you are making are correct & preserve the original patch logic as much as possible.\n\nGENERAL IMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. It is okay to scroll only if you cannot determine the location by other means. Similarly when searching for a function, instead of scrolling down, use the search command to find the function name.\n\n3. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally to write code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it. ALWAYS USE PROPER INDENTATION WHEN EDITING FILES EVEN IF THE SYNTAX IS CORRECT WITHOUT INDENTATION. Code readability is important.\n\n4. Do not try to install any packages with `pip`, `conda`, or any other way. This is NOT ALLOWED. If the environment is not set up correctly, try to fix the issue without executing python code or running any tests that require the package installed. DO NOT Use interactive commands either. You have ONE toolcall per response, and the toolcall should be complete in itself. You wont be able to interact with it.\n\n5. Preserve the comments from the original patch whenever possible. They are important for understanding the code.\n\n6. In case exact matches are unavaialable, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history & New-Code to Old-Code mapping to find potential matches. But always verify your knowledge by checking the contents of the files and functions.\n\n7. You're working on a really big repo. So,  DO NOT use `ls -R` command to list all the files in the repo. Instead, use `find` command to find the files you want to edit. For example, if you want to find a file named `foo.py`, use `find . -name foo.py`.\nAlso make sure you understand interface limitations, OPEN files only, View directories only, etc.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n\n1. You don't need to worry about testing the fix. Try minimal self testing if available. But if it is not available or not running properly, don't worry about it.\n\n2. Read the changes to be applied from the original patch carefully. The `open` command only shows 100 lines, if the patch is longer make sure you scroll down to see the complete file. Make sure you understand all the chunks of the patch that need to be manually applied. Print all the description of changes it does in your thoughts as it will be served to you in the history in future prompts. And start making changes one by one.\n\n3. Locate relevant code using the find and search commands. `open` the file you want to edit. Use these tools most of the time to make yourself familier with the code base. Better understanding is preferred.\n\n4. Your knowlege of libsoup commit history is a powerful tool, list out in thoughts the 'Old-Code' to 'New-Code' mappings and use it to find potential file, function, line numbers.\nThis is NOT absolute, and you must verify your findings by checking the contents of the files and functions.\nTry this only once, and your potential matches not work, use special-interface commands to navigate and find the relevant code.\nAlways prefer codebase search over your knowledge of commit history.\n\n5. Use the `edit` command to perform edits.\n\nTOOL USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. The Tool Command 'OPEN' is ONLY to open files. DO NOT try to OPEN directories, this will FAIL the entire task instantly. Use 'VIEW' command to view directories, and 'OPEN' for files.\nFor example, DO NOT try to OPEN '/swe_repo/code_base/' since it is a directory and this will FAIL the entire task instantly.\n\n2. The file contents are TOO LARGE, if you try to OPEN entire file, it will take up too many tokens. Try to find function names, lines, etc using regex, or ask to cat 10-30 lines of file code at a time.\n\n3. Contents of Directories are TOO LARGE, do not try to use 'ls -R' on them. find specific files. use regex.\n\n4. Interactive Commands like 'vi' DO NOT WORK AT ALL. DO NOT USE THEM. If you try to use them, it will FAIL the entire task instantly. Use Commands like cat to open a file.\n\n5. You can Only Work on libsoup repo. (--code-repo). DO NOT try to open or edit any other files outside this repo. If you try to do so, it will FAIL the entire task instantly.\n   Do NOT in any way change the original patch. You DO NOT have permissions outside the code repo.\n\n(Open file: )\n(Current directory: /swe_repo)\nbash-$",

THIS is NOT the standard command line interface.\nThis interface has its own Rules & limitations, work IN THOSE LIMITATIONS Only.\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you 100 lines of a file at a time.\nThe special interface DOES NOT allow any interactive commands like `vi`. Non interactive commands like `cat`, `find`, `grep`, etc are allowed.\nAlso, it has some specific commands with PROPER LIMITATIONS: (like `OPEN` (File ONLY), `VIEW` (Directory ONLY) etc.)\n\nTo backport the patch, DO NOT Try to Cherrypick.\nApply the patch MANUALLY.\n\nFirst, read the full patch and understand the changes in the patch.\nThen, find what files, functions are being changed.\nThen, locate those files and functions in the OLD code base.\n\nIf you cannot find an exact match, use your knowledge of Libsoup COMMIT HISTORY.\nMention what files, functions in the LATEST version map to what files, functions in the OLD version.\nThen based on this, mention potential filenames, functionnames that the Latest patch might be referring to in the Old code base.\n\nThen, use the special interface to search the codebase and make corresponding changes to the codebase based on the patch.\nuse commands like `find`, `goto`, `grep`, etc. to find the relevant code in the OLD code base and backport the patch.\nuse regex to find filenames/paths, function names, etc. in case exact matches are not found.\n\nExample:\nif the Patch changes `src/lib/soup-foo.c` file,\n1. First, try to find the exact file in the OLD code base.\n2. If you cannot find the exact file, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history, to map filename of `src/lib/soup-foo.c` in the LATEST version to filename in the OLD version.\n3. if you still cannot find the exact file, try to find potential filenames using regex search or searching contents of file.\n4. Always check your findings with your knowledge of libsoup commit history, and ensure that file you found is indeed the correct file.\n\nExample:\nif the Patch changes a function named `soup_foo_bar()` in `src/soup_decoder/is-bar.c` file,\n1. First, try to find the exact function in the OLD code base.\n2. If you cannot find the exact function, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history, to map function name of `soup_foo_bar()` in the LATEST version to OLD version.\nfor example, it might be named `soup_foo_bar_v2()` in the OLD version, or it might have been moved to some other file, or broken into multiple functions, etc.\nbased on this, make a list of potential matches.\n\nTry to PRESERVE the original patch as much as possible, including comments and formatting.\nYou will be penalized for changes that deviate from the patch logic unnecessarily.\n\nMake sure that all your search, edits are within the `--code-base` directory.\nAny changes outside this directory will FAIL the task immediately.\n\nThe files & directories are very large.\nif you try to open a very large file, or list a very large directory, it will take up too many tokens and you will be penalized.\nSo, use commands like `find`, `grep`, etc. to locate files and functions and then use commands like `goto` to jump to specific lines.\n\nTo navigate/edit the codebase using the special interface, invoke the interface with a function call/tool call.\n\nGive special importance to the indentation and whitespaces in the code which are related to syntax.\nFor example, if you are looking at this file:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello world\")\n\nand you want to edit the file to read:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello\")\n    print(\"world\")\n\nyour search string should be `Hello world` and your replace string should be `\"Hello\"\\n    print(\"world\")`\n(note the extra spaces before the print statement!).\nYou could also get the same result by search for `    print(\"Hello world\")` and replace with `    print(\"Hello\")\\n    print(\"world\")`.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>)\n(Current directory: <cwd>)\nbash-$\n\nFirst, you should ALWAYS include a general thought about what you're going to do next.\nThe thought should either be based on Last Observation or Your Libsoup Commit History knowledge.\nThen, for every response, you must include exactly ONE tool call/function call.\n\nNote that the special interface DOES NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them. Any command that require interactive session like \"git show\", \"git log\", etc., will not work. So, DON'T USE ANY INTERACTIVE SESSION COMMANDS OR THEIR DERIVATIVES LIKE `git log --grep=`, `git show HEAD`, `git diff --cached`, etc.,. When you want to run these commands, redirect them to a temporary file and open it for reading. For example, `git log --oneline > /backport/tmp/git_log.txt`.",

          "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n  If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n  Then start trying to fix it.\n  When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n  If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n  so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /testbed)\nbash-$",

          "content": "PROBLEM_STATEMENT:\n\nBackport the `original.patch` file to the `code_base` directory. Both the `original.patch` file and the `code_base` directory are available in the current working directory.\nFirst move the `original.patch` file to `/root/original.patch` and then change your working directory to the `code_base` directory by running `cd code_base`. \nNote that ANY Changes outside code_base directory, for instance to the original.patch file, will FAIL the task immediately.\n\nRead the patch file carefully and understand the changes it is making. Then, make the necessary changes in the code base, commit the changes, generate a new patch with `git format-patch -1 HEAD`, and then submit the changes using the `submit <patch_file>` command.\n\nYour git username is `AllSpark` and your email is `allspark@microsoft.com`.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your special-interface terminal session has started. You can use any bash NON-Interactive commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIf exact matches do not exist, use your knowledge of Libsoup commit history to find potential matches based on what files, functions of New Version Map to in the old version.\nNote that these are ONLY POTENTIAL matches, so make sure to verify them by checking the contents of the files and functions. use regex, `find`, `grep`, etc. to further improve your search.\nAlways understand the patch logic, the file content and ensure that the changes you are making are correct & preserve the original patch logic as much as possible.\n\nGENERAL IMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. It is okay to scroll only if you cannot determine the location by other means. Similarly when searching for a function, instead of scrolling down, use the search command to find the function name.\n\n3. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally to write code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it. ALWAYS USE PROPER INDENTATION WHEN EDITING FILES EVEN IF THE SYNTAX IS CORRECT WITHOUT INDENTATION. Code readability is important.\n\n4. Do not try to install any packages with `pip`, `conda`, or any other way. This is NOT ALLOWED. If the environment is not set up correctly, try to fix the issue without executing python code or running any tests that require the package installed. DO NOT Use interactive commands either. You have ONE toolcall per response, and the toolcall should be complete in itself. You wont be able to interact with it.\n\n5. Preserve the comments from the original patch whenever possible. They are important for understanding the code.\n\n6. In case exact matches are unavaialable, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history & New-Code to Old-Code mapping to find potential matches. But always verify your knowledge by checking the contents of the files and functions.\n\n7. You're working on a really big repo. So,  DO NOT use `ls -R` command to list all the files in the repo. Instead, use `find` command to find the files you want to edit. For example, if you want to find a file named `foo.py`, use `find . -name foo.py`.\nAlso make sure you understand interface limitations, OPEN files only, View directories only, etc.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n\n1. You don't need to worry about testing the fix. Try minimal self testing if available. But if it is not available or not running properly, don't worry about it.\n\n2. Read the changes to be applied from the original patch carefully. The `open` command only shows 100 lines, if the patch is longer make sure you scroll down to see the complete file. Make sure you understand all the chunks of the patch that need to be manually applied. Print all the description of changes it does in your thoughts as it will be served to you in the history in future prompts. And start making changes one by one.\n\n3. Locate relevant code using the find and search commands. `open` the file you want to edit. Use these tools most of the time to make yourself familier with the code base. Better understanding is preferred.\n\n4. Your knowlege of libsoup commit history is a powerful tool, list out in thoughts the 'Old-Code' to 'New-Code' mappings and use it to find potential file, function, line numbers.\nThis is NOT absolute, and you must verify your findings by checking the contents of the files and functions.\nTry this only once, and your potential matches not work, use special-interface commands to navigate and find the relevant code.\nAlways prefer codebase search over your knowledge of commit history.\n\n5. Use the `edit` command to perform edits.\n\nTOOL USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. The Tool Command 'OPEN' is ONLY to open files. DO NOT try to OPEN directories, this will FAIL the entire task instantly. Use 'VIEW' command to view directories, and 'OPEN' for files.\nFor example, DO NOT try to OPEN '/swe_repo/code_base/' since it is a directory and this will FAIL the entire task instantly.\n\n2. The file contents are TOO LARGE, if you try to OPEN entire file, it will take up too many tokens. Try to find function names, lines, etc using regex, or ask to cat 10-30 lines of file code at a time.\n\n3. Contents of Directories are TOO LARGE, do not try to use 'ls -R' on them. find specific files. use regex.\n\n4. Interactive Commands like 'vi' DO NOT WORK AT ALL. DO NOT USE THEM. If you try to use them, it will FAIL the entire task instantly. Use Commands like cat to open a file.\n\n5. You can Only Work on libsoup repo. (--code-repo). DO NOT try to open or edit any other files outside this repo. If you try to do so, it will FAIL the entire task instantly.\n   Do NOT in any way change the original patch. You DO NOT have permissions outside the code repo.\n\n(Open file: )\n(Current directory: /swe_repo)\nbash-$",

          "content": "SETTING:\nYou are a software developer with extensive knowledge of Libsoup Package, and its commit history.\n\nYour primary job is to backport a patch written for LATEST version of Libsoup, into the OLD version of Libsoup.\n\nFor this, you will be given a specially designed command line interface. THIS is NOT the standard command line interface.\nThis interface has its own Rules & limitations, work IN THOSE LIMITATIONS Only.\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you 100 lines of a file at a time.\nThe special interface DOES NOT allow any interactive commands like `vi`. Non interactive commands like `cat`, `find`, `grep`, etc are allowed.\nAlso, it has some specific commands with PROPER LIMITATIONS: (like `OPEN` (File ONLY), `VIEW` (Directory ONLY) etc.)\n\nTo backport the patch, DO NOT Try to Cherrypick.\nApply the patch MANUALLY.\n\nFirst, read the full patch and understand the changes in the patch.\nThen, find what files, functions are being changed.\nThen, locate those files and functions in the OLD code base.\n\nIf you cannot find an exact match, use your knowledge of Libsoup COMMIT HISTORY.\nMention what files, functions in the LATEST version map to what files, functions in the OLD version.\nThen based on this, mention potential filenames, functionnames that the Latest patch might be referring to in the Old code base.\n\nThen, use the special interface to search the codebase and make corresponding changes to the codebase based on the patch.\nuse commands like `find`, `goto`, `grep`, etc. to find the relevant code in the OLD code base and backport the patch.\nuse regex to find filenames/paths, function names, etc. in case exact matches are not found.\n\nExample:\nif the Patch changes `src/lib/soup-foo.c` file,\n1. First, try to find the exact file in the OLD code base.\n2. If you cannot find the exact file, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history, to map filename of `src/lib/soup-foo.c` in the LATEST version to filename in the OLD version.\n3. if you still cannot find the exact file, try to find potential filenames using regex search or searching contents of file.\n4. Always check your findings with your knowledge of libsoup commit history, and ensure that file you found is indeed the correct file.\n\nExample:\nif the Patch changes a function named `soup_foo_bar()` in `src/soup_decoder/is-bar.c` file,\n1. First, try to find the exact function in the OLD code base.\n2. If you cannot find the exact function, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history, to map function name of `soup_foo_bar()` in the LATEST version to OLD version.\nfor example, it might be named `soup_foo_bar_v2()` in the OLD version, or it might have been moved to some other file, or broken into multiple functions, etc.\nbased on this, make a list of potential matches.\n\nTry to PRESERVE the original patch as much as possible, including comments and formatting.\nYou will be penalized for changes that deviate from the patch logic unnecessarily.\n\nMake sure that all your search, edits are within the `--code-base` directory.\nAny changes outside this directory will FAIL the task immediately.\n\nThe files & directories are very large.\nif you try to open a very large file, or list a very large directory, it will take up too many tokens and you will be penalized.\nSo, use commands like `find`, `grep`, etc. to locate files and functions and then use commands like `goto` to jump to specific lines.\n\nTo navigate/edit the codebase using the special interface, invoke the interface with a function call/tool call.\n\nGive special importance to the indentation and whitespaces in the code which are related to syntax.\nFor example, if you are looking at this file:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello world\")\n\nand you want to edit the file to read:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello\")\n    print(\"world\")\n\nyour search string should be `Hello world` and your replace string should be `\"Hello\"\\n    print(\"world\")`\n(note the extra spaces before the print statement!).\nYou could also get the same result by search for `    print(\"Hello world\")` and replace with `    print(\"Hello\")\\n    print(\"world\")`.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>)\n(Current directory: <cwd>)\nbash-$\n\nFirst, you should ALWAYS include a general thought about what you're going to do next.\nThe thought should either be based on Last Observation or Your Libsoup Commit History knowledge.\nThen, for every response, you must include exactly ONE tool call/function call.\n\nNote that the special interface DOES NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them. Any command that require interactive session like \"git show\", \"git log\", etc., will not work. So, DON'T USE ANY INTERACTIVE SESSION COMMANDS OR THEIR DERIVATIVES LIKE `git log --grep=`, `git show HEAD`, `git diff --cached`, etc.,. When you want to run these commands, redirect them to a temporary file and open it for reading. For example, `git log --oneline > /backport/tmp/git_log.txt`.",

          "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n  If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n  Then start trying to fix it.\n  When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n  If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n  so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /testbed)\nbash-$",

          "content": "PROBLEM_STATEMENT:\n\nBackport the `original.patch` file to the `code_base` directory. Both the `original.patch` file and the `code_base` directory are available in the current working directory.\nFirst move the `original.patch` file to `/root/original.patch` and then change your working directory to the `code_base` directory by running `cd code_base`. \nNote that ANY Changes outside code_base directory, for instance to the original.patch file, will FAIL the task immediately.\n\nRead the patch file carefully and understand the changes it is making. Then, make the necessary changes in the code base, commit the changes, generate a new patch with `git format-patch -1 HEAD`, and then submit the changes using the `submit <patch_file>` command.\n\nYour git username is `AllSpark` and your email is `allspark@microsoft.com`.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your special-interface terminal session has started. You can use any bash NON-Interactive commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIf exact matches do not exist, use your knowledge of Libsoup commit history to find potential matches based on what files, functions of New Version Map to in the old version.\nNote that these are ONLY POTENTIAL matches, so make sure to verify them by checking the contents of the files and functions. use regex, `find`, `grep`, etc. to further improve your search.\nAlways understand the patch logic, the file content and ensure that the changes you are making are correct & preserve the original patch logic as much as possible.\n\nGENERAL IMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. It is okay to scroll only if you cannot determine the location by other means. Similarly when searching for a function, instead of scrolling down, use the search command to find the function name.\n\n3. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally to write code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it. ALWAYS USE PROPER INDENTATION WHEN EDITING FILES EVEN IF THE SYNTAX IS CORRECT WITHOUT INDENTATION. Code readability is important.\n\n4. Do not try to install any packages with `pip`, `conda`, or any other way. This is NOT ALLOWED. If the environment is not set up correctly, try to fix the issue without executing python code or running any tests that require the package installed. DO NOT Use interactive commands either. You have ONE toolcall per response, and the toolcall should be complete in itself. You wont be able to interact with it.\n\n5. Preserve the comments from the original patch whenever possible. They are important for understanding the code.\n\n6. In case exact matches are unavaialable, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history & New-Code to Old-Code mapping to find potential matches. But always verify your knowledge by checking the contents of the files and functions.\n\n7. You're working on a really big repo. So,  DO NOT use `ls -R` command to list all the files in the repo. Instead, use `find` command to find the files you want to edit. For example, if you want to find a file named `foo.py`, use `find . -name foo.py`.\nAlso make sure you understand interface limitations, OPEN files only, View directories only, etc.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n\n1. You don't need to worry about testing the fix. Try minimal self testing if available. But if it is not available or not running properly, don't worry about it.\n\n2. Read the changes to be applied from the original patch carefully. The `open` command only shows 100 lines, if the patch is longer make sure you scroll down to see the complete file. Make sure you understand all the chunks of the patch that need to be manually applied. Print all the description of changes it does in your thoughts as it will be served to you in the history in future prompts. And start making changes one by one.\n\n3. Locate relevant code using the find and search commands. `open` the file you want to edit. Use these tools most of the time to make yourself familier with the code base. Better understanding is preferred.\n\n4. Your knowlege of libsoup commit history is a powerful tool, list out in thoughts the 'Old-Code' to 'New-Code' mappings and use it to find potential file, function, line numbers.\nThis is NOT absolute, and you must verify your findings by checking the contents of the files and functions.\nTry this only once, and your potential matches not work, use special-interface commands to navigate and find the relevant code.\nAlways prefer codebase search over your knowledge of commit history.\n\n5. Use the `edit` command to perform edits.\n\nTOOL USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. The Tool Command 'OPEN' is ONLY to open files. DO NOT try to OPEN directories, this will FAIL the entire task instantly. Use 'VIEW' command to view directories, and 'OPEN' for files.\nFor example, DO NOT try to OPEN '/swe_repo/code_base/' since it is a directory and this will FAIL the entire task instantly.\n\n2. The file contents are TOO LARGE, if you try to OPEN entire file, it will take up too many tokens. Try to find function names, lines, etc using regex, or ask to cat 10-30 lines of file code at a time.\n\n3. Contents of Directories are TOO LARGE, do not try to use 'ls -R' on them. find specific files. use regex.\n\n4. Interactive Commands like 'vi' DO NOT WORK AT ALL. DO NOT USE THEM. If you try to use them, it will FAIL the entire task instantly. Use Commands like cat to open a file.\n\n5. You can Only Work on libsoup repo. (--code-repo). DO NOT try to open or edit any other files outside this repo. If you try to do so, it will FAIL the entire task instantly.\n   Do NOT in any way change the original patch. You DO NOT have permissions outside the code repo.\n\n(Open file: )\n(Current directory: /swe_repo)\nbash-$",

          "content": "SETTING:\nYou are a software developer with extensive knowledge of Libsoup Package, and its commit history.\n\nYour primary job is to backport a patch written for LATEST version of Libsoup, into the OLD version of Libsoup.\n\nFor this, you will be given a specially designed command line interface. THIS is NOT the standard command line interface.\nThis interface has its own Rules & limitations, work IN THOSE LIMITATIONS Only.\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you 100 lines of a file at a time.\nThe special interface DOES NOT allow any interactive commands like `vi`. Non interactive commands like `cat`, `find`, `grep`, etc are allowed.\nAlso, it has some specific commands with PROPER LIMITATIONS: (like `OPEN` (File ONLY), `VIEW` (Directory ONLY) etc.)\n\nTo backport the patch, DO NOT Try to Cherrypick.\nApply the patch MANUALLY.\n\nFirst, read the full patch and understand the changes in the patch.\nThen, find what files, functions are being changed.\nThen, locate those files and functions in the OLD code base.\n\nIf you cannot find an exact match, use your knowledge of Libsoup COMMIT HISTORY.\nMention what files, functions in the LATEST version map to what files, functions in the OLD version.\nThen based on this, mention potential filenames, functionnames that the Latest patch might be referring to in the Old code base.\n\nThen, use the special interface to search the codebase and make corresponding changes to the codebase based on the patch.\nuse commands like `find`, `goto`, `grep`, etc. to find the relevant code in the OLD code base and backport the patch.\nuse regex to find filenames/paths, function names, etc. in case exact matches are not found.\n\nExample:\nif the Patch changes `src/lib/soup-foo.c` file,\n1. First, try to find the exact file in the OLD code base.\n2. If you cannot find the exact file, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history, to map filename of `src/lib/soup-foo.c` in the LATEST version to filename in the OLD version.\n3. if you still cannot find the exact file, try to find potential filenames using regex search or searching contents of file.\n4. Always check your findings with your knowledge of libsoup commit history, and ensure that file you found is indeed the correct file.\n\nExample:\nif the Patch changes a function named `soup_foo_bar()` in `src/soup_decoder/is-bar.c` file,\n1. First, try to find the exact function in the OLD code base.\n2. If you cannot find the exact function, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history, to map function name of `soup_foo_bar()` in the LATEST version to OLD version.\nfor example, it might be named `soup_foo_bar_v2()` in the OLD version, or it might have been moved to some other file, or broken into multiple functions, etc.\nbased on this, make a list of potential matches.\n\nTry to PRESERVE the original patch as much as possible, including comments and formatting.\nYou will be penalized for changes that deviate from the patch logic unnecessarily.\n\nMake sure that all your search, edits are within the `--code-base` directory.\nAny changes outside this directory will FAIL the task immediately.\n\nThe files & directories are very large.\nif you try to open a very large file, or list a very large directory, it will take up too many tokens and you will be penalized.\nSo, use commands like `find`, `grep`, etc. to locate files and functions and then use commands like `goto` to jump to specific lines.\n\nTo navigate/edit the codebase using the special interface, invoke the interface with a function call/tool call.\n\nGive special importance to the indentation and whitespaces in the code which are related to syntax.\nFor example, if you are looking at this file:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello world\")\n\nand you want to edit the file to read:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello\")\n    print(\"world\")\n\nyour search string should be `Hello world` and your replace string should be `\"Hello\"\\n    print(\"world\")`\n(note the extra spaces before the print statement!).\nYou could also get the same result by search for `    print(\"Hello world\")` and replace with `    print(\"Hello\")\\n    print(\"world\")`.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>)\n(Current directory: <cwd>)\nbash-$\n\nFirst, you should ALWAYS include a general thought about what you're going to do next.\nThe thought should either be based on Last Observation or Your Libsoup Commit History knowledge.\nThen, for every response, you must include exactly ONE tool call/function call.\n\nNote that the special interface DOES NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them. Any command that require interactive session like \"git show\", \"git log\", etc., will not work. So, DON'T USE ANY INTERACTIVE SESSION COMMANDS OR THEIR DERIVATIVES LIKE `git log --grep=`, `git show HEAD`, `git diff --cached`, etc.,. When you want to run these commands, redirect them to a temporary file and open it for reading. For example, `git log --oneline > /backport/tmp/git_log.txt`.",

          "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n  If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n  Then start trying to fix it.\n  When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n  If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n  so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /testbed)\nbash-$",

          "content": "PROBLEM_STATEMENT:\n\nBackport the `original.patch` file to the `code_base` directory. Both the `original.patch` file and the `code_base` directory are available in the current working directory.\nFirst move the `original.patch` file to `/root/original.patch` and then change your working directory to the `code_base` directory by running `cd code_base`. \nNote that ANY Changes outside code_base directory, for instance to the original.patch file, will FAIL the task immediately.\n\nRead the patch file carefully and understand the changes it is making. Then, make the necessary changes in the code base, commit the changes, generate a new patch with `git format-patch -1 HEAD`, and then submit the changes using the `submit <patch_file>` command.\n\nYour git username is `AllSpark` and your email is `allspark@microsoft.com`.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your special-interface terminal session has started. You can use any bash NON-Interactive commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIf exact matches do not exist, use your knowledge of Libsoup commit history to find potential matches based on what files, functions of New Version Map to in the old version.\nNote that these are ONLY POTENTIAL matches, so make sure to verify them by checking the contents of the files and functions. use regex, `find`, `grep`, etc. to further improve your search.\nAlways understand the patch logic, the file content and ensure that the changes you are making are correct & preserve the original patch logic as much as possible.\n\nGENERAL IMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. It is okay to scroll only if you cannot determine the location by other means. Similarly when searching for a function, instead of scrolling down, use the search command to find the function name.\n\n3. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally to write code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it. ALWAYS USE PROPER INDENTATION WHEN EDITING FILES EVEN IF THE SYNTAX IS CORRECT WITHOUT INDENTATION. Code readability is important.\n\n4. Do not try to install any packages with `pip`, `conda`, or any other way. This is NOT ALLOWED. If the environment is not set up correctly, try to fix the issue without executing python code or running any tests that require the package installed. DO NOT Use interactive commands either. You have ONE toolcall per response, and the toolcall should be complete in itself. You wont be able to interact with it.\n\n5. Preserve the comments from the original patch whenever possible. They are important for understanding the code.\n\n6. In case exact matches are unavaialable, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history & New-Code to Old-Code mapping to find potential matches. But always verify your knowledge by checking the contents of the files and functions.\n\n7. You're working on a really big repo. So,  DO NOT use `ls -R` command to list all the files in the repo. Instead, use `find` command to find the files you want to edit. For example, if you want to find a file named `foo.py`, use `find . -name foo.py`.\nAlso make sure you understand interface limitations, OPEN files only, View directories only, etc.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n\n1. You don't need to worry about testing the fix. Try minimal self testing if available. But if it is not available or not running properly, don't worry about it.\n\n2. Read the changes to be applied from the original patch carefully. The `open` command only shows 100 lines, if the patch is longer make sure you scroll down to see the complete file. Make sure you understand all the chunks of the patch that need to be manually applied. Print all the description of changes it does in your thoughts as it will be served to you in the history in future prompts. And start making changes one by one.\n\n3. Locate relevant code using the find and search commands. `open` the file you want to edit. Use these tools most of the time to make yourself familier with the code base. Better understanding is preferred.\n\n4. Your knowlege of libsoup commit history is a powerful tool, list out in thoughts the 'Old-Code' to 'New-Code' mappings and use it to find potential file, function, line numbers.\nThis is NOT absolute, and you must verify your findings by checking the contents of the files and functions.\nTry this only once, and your potential matches not work, use special-interface commands to navigate and find the relevant code.\nAlways prefer codebase search over your knowledge of commit history.\n\n5. Use the `edit` command to perform edits.\n\nTOOL USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. The Tool Command 'OPEN' is ONLY to open files. DO NOT try to OPEN directories, this will FAIL the entire task instantly. Use 'VIEW' command to view directories, and 'OPEN' for files.\nFor example, DO NOT try to OPEN '/swe_repo/code_base/' since it is a directory and this will FAIL the entire task instantly.\n\n2. The file contents are TOO LARGE, if you try to OPEN entire file, it will take up too many tokens. Try to find function names, lines, etc using regex, or ask to cat 10-30 lines of file code at a time.\n\n3. Contents of Directories are TOO LARGE, do not try to use 'ls -R' on them. find specific files. use regex.\n\n4. Interactive Commands like 'vi' DO NOT WORK AT ALL. DO NOT USE THEM. If you try to use them, it will FAIL the entire task instantly. Use Commands like cat to open a file.\n\n5. You can Only Work on libsoup repo. (--code-repo). DO NOT try to open or edit any other files outside this repo. If you try to do so, it will FAIL the entire task instantly.\n   Do NOT in any way change the original patch. You DO NOT have permissions outside the code repo.\n\n(Open file: )\n(Current directory: /swe_repo)\nbash-$",

          "content": "SETTING:\nYou are a software developer with extensive knowledge of Libsoup Package, and its commit history.\n\nYour primary job is to backport a patch written for LATEST version of Libsoup, into the OLD version of Libsoup.\n\nFor this, you will be given a specially designed command line interface. THIS is NOT the standard command line interface.\nThis interface has its own Rules & limitations, work IN THOSE LIMITATIONS Only.\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you 100 lines of a file at a time.\nThe special interface DOES NOT allow any interactive commands like `vi`. Non interactive commands like `cat`, `find`, `grep`, etc are allowed.\nAlso, it has some specific commands with PROPER LIMITATIONS: (like `OPEN` (File ONLY), `VIEW` (Directory ONLY) etc.)\n\nTo backport the patch, DO NOT Try to Cherrypick.\nApply the patch MANUALLY.\n\nFirst, read the full patch and understand the changes in the patch.\nThen, find what files, functions are being changed.\nThen, locate those files and functions in the OLD code base.\n\nIf you cannot find an exact match, use your knowledge of Libsoup COMMIT HISTORY.\nMention what files, functions in the LATEST version map to what files, functions in the OLD version.\nThen based on this, mention potential filenames, functionnames that the Latest patch might be referring to in the Old code base.\n\nThen, use the special interface to search the codebase and make corresponding changes to the codebase based on the patch.\nuse commands like `find`, `goto`, `grep`, etc. to find the relevant code in the OLD code base and backport the patch.\nuse regex to find filenames/paths, function names, etc. in case exact matches are not found.\n\nExample:\nif the Patch changes `src/lib/soup-foo.c` file,\n1. First, try to find the exact file in the OLD code base.\n2. If you cannot find the exact file, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history, to map filename of `src/lib/soup-foo.c` in the LATEST version to filename in the OLD version.\n3. if you still cannot find the exact file, try to find potential filenames using regex search or searching contents of file.\n4. Always check your findings with your knowledge of libsoup commit history, and ensure that file you found is indeed the correct file.\n\nExample:\nif the Patch changes a function named `soup_foo_bar()` in `src/soup_decoder/is-bar.c` file,\n1. First, try to find the exact function in the OLD code base.\n2. If you cannot find the exact function, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history, to map function name of `soup_foo_bar()` in the LATEST version to OLD version.\nfor example, it might be named `soup_foo_bar_v2()` in the OLD version, or it might have been moved to some other file, or broken into multiple functions, etc.\nbased on this, make a list of potential matches.\n\nTry to PRESERVE the original patch as much as possible, including comments and formatting.\nYou will be penalized for changes that deviate from the patch logic unnecessarily.\n\nMake sure that all your search, edits are within the `--code-base` directory.\nAny changes outside this directory will FAIL the task immediately.\n\nThe files & directories are very large.\nif you try to open a very large file, or list a very large directory, it will take up too many tokens and you will be penalized.\nSo, use commands like `find`, `grep`, etc. to locate files and functions and then use commands like `goto` to jump to specific lines.\n\nTo navigate/edit the codebase using the special interface, invoke the interface with a function call/tool call.\n\nGive special importance to the indentation and whitespaces in the code which are related to syntax.\nFor example, if you are looking at this file:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello world\")\n\nand you want to edit the file to read:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello\")\n    print(\"world\")\n\nyour search string should be `Hello world` and your replace string should be `\"Hello\"\\n    print(\"world\")`\n(note the extra spaces before the print statement!).\nYou could also get the same result by search for `    print(\"Hello world\")` and replace with `    print(\"Hello\")\\n    print(\"world\")`.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>)\n(Current directory: <cwd>)\nbash-$\n\nFirst, you should ALWAYS include a general thought about what you're going to do next.\nThe thought should either be based on Last Observation or Your Libsoup Commit History knowledge.\nThen, for every response, you must include exactly ONE tool call/function call.\n\nNote that the special interface DOES NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them. Any command that require interactive session like \"git show\", \"git log\", etc., will not work. So, DON'T USE ANY INTERACTIVE SESSION COMMANDS OR THEIR DERIVATIVES LIKE `git log --grep=`, `git show HEAD`, `git diff --cached`, etc.,. When you want to run these commands, redirect them to a temporary file and open it for reading. For example, `git log --oneline > /backport/tmp/git_log.txt`.",

          "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n  If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n  Then start trying to fix it.\n  When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n  If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n  so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /testbed)\nbash-$",

          "content": "PROBLEM_STATEMENT:\n\nBackport the `original.patch` file to the `code_base` directory. Both the `original.patch` file and the `code_base` directory are available in the current working directory.\nFirst move the `original.patch` file to `/root/original.patch` and then change your working directory to the `code_base` directory by running `cd code_base`. \nNote that ANY Changes outside code_base directory, for instance to the original.patch file, will FAIL the task immediately.\n\nRead the patch file carefully and understand the changes it is making. Then, make the necessary changes in the code base, commit the changes, generate a new patch with `git format-patch -1 HEAD`, and then submit the changes using the `submit <patch_file>` command.\n\nYour git username is `AllSpark` and your email is `allspark@microsoft.com`.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your special-interface terminal session has started. You can use any bash NON-Interactive commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIf exact matches do not exist, use your knowledge of Libsoup commit history to find potential matches based on what files, functions of New Version Map to in the old version.\nNote that these are ONLY POTENTIAL matches, so make sure to verify them by checking the contents of the files and functions. use regex, `find`, `grep`, etc. to further improve your search.\nAlways understand the patch logic, the file content and ensure that the changes you are making are correct & preserve the original patch logic as much as possible.\n\nGENERAL IMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. It is okay to scroll only if you cannot determine the location by other means. Similarly when searching for a function, instead of scrolling down, use the search command to find the function name.\n\n3. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally to write code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it. ALWAYS USE PROPER INDENTATION WHEN EDITING FILES EVEN IF THE SYNTAX IS CORRECT WITHOUT INDENTATION. Code readability is important.\n\n4. Do not try to install any packages with `pip`, `conda`, or any other way. This is NOT ALLOWED. If the environment is not set up correctly, try to fix the issue without executing python code or running any tests that require the package installed. DO NOT Use interactive commands either. You have ONE toolcall per response, and the toolcall should be complete in itself. You wont be able to interact with it.\n\n5. Preserve the comments from the original patch whenever possible. They are important for understanding the code.\n\n6. In case exact matches are unavaialable, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history & New-Code to Old-Code mapping to find potential matches. But always verify your knowledge by checking the contents of the files and functions.\n\n7. You're working on a really big repo. So,  DO NOT use `ls -R` command to list all the files in the repo. Instead, use `find` command to find the files you want to edit. For example, if you want to find a file named `foo.py`, use `find . -name foo.py`.\nAlso make sure you understand interface limitations, OPEN files only, View directories only, etc.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n\n1. You don't need to worry about testing the fix. Try minimal self testing if available. But if it is not available or not running properly, don't worry about it.\n\n2. Read the changes to be applied from the original patch carefully. The `open` command only shows 100 lines, if the patch is longer make sure you scroll down to see the complete file. Make sure you understand all the chunks of the patch that need to be manually applied. Print all the description of changes it does in your thoughts as it will be served to you in the history in future prompts. And start making changes one by one.\n\n3. Locate relevant code using the find and search commands. `open` the file you want to edit. Use these tools most of the time to make yourself familier with the code base. Better understanding is preferred.\n\n4. Your knowlege of libsoup commit history is a powerful tool, list out in thoughts the 'Old-Code' to 'New-Code' mappings and use it to find potential file, function, line numbers.\nThis is NOT absolute, and you must verify your findings by checking the contents of the files and functions.\nTry this only once, and your potential matches not work, use special-interface commands to navigate and find the relevant code.\nAlways prefer codebase search over your knowledge of commit history.\n\n5. Use the `edit` command to perform edits.\n\nTOOL USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. The Tool Command 'OPEN' is ONLY to open files. DO NOT try to OPEN directories, this will FAIL the entire task instantly. Use 'VIEW' command to view directories, and 'OPEN' for files.\nFor example, DO NOT try to OPEN '/swe_repo/code_base/' since it is a directory and this will FAIL the entire task instantly.\n\n2. The file contents are TOO LARGE, if you try to OPEN entire file, it will take up too many tokens. Try to find function names, lines, etc using regex, or ask to cat 10-30 lines of file code at a time.\n\n3. Contents of Directories are TOO LARGE, do not try to use 'ls -R' on them. find specific files. use regex.\n\n4. Interactive Commands like 'vi' DO NOT WORK AT ALL. DO NOT USE THEM. If you try to use them, it will FAIL the entire task instantly. Use Commands like cat to open a file.\n\n5. You can Only Work on libsoup repo. (--code-repo). DO NOT try to open or edit any other files outside this repo. If you try to do so, it will FAIL the entire task instantly.\n   Do NOT in any way change the original patch. You DO NOT have permissions outside the code repo.\n\n(Open file: )\n(Current directory: /swe_repo)\nbash-$",

      "content": "SETTING:\nYou are a software developer with extensive knowledge of Libsoup Package, and its commit history.\n\nYour primary job is to backport a patch written for LATEST version of Libsoup, into the OLD version of Libsoup.\n\nFor this, you will be given a specially designed command line interface. THIS is NOT the standard command line interface.\nThis interface has its own Rules & limitations, work IN THOSE LIMITATIONS Only.\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you 100 lines of a file at a time.\nThe special interface DOES NOT allow any interactive commands like `vi`. Non interactive commands like `cat`, `find`, `grep`, etc are allowed.\nAlso, it has some specific commands with PROPER LIMITATIONS: (like `OPEN` (File ONLY), `VIEW` (Directory ONLY) etc.)\n\nTo backport the patch, DO NOT Try to Cherrypick.\nApply the patch MANUALLY.\n\nFirst, read the full patch and understand the changes in the patch.\nThen, find what files, functions are being changed.\nThen, locate those files and functions in the OLD code base.\n\nIf you cannot find an exact match, use your knowledge of Libsoup COMMIT HISTORY.\nMention what files, functions in the LATEST version map to what files, functions in the OLD version.\nThen based on this, mention potential filenames, functionnames that the Latest patch might be referring to in the Old code base.\n\nThen, use the special interface to search the codebase and make corresponding changes to the codebase based on the patch.\nuse commands like `find`, `goto`, `grep`, etc. to find the relevant code in the OLD code base and backport the patch.\nuse regex to find filenames/paths, function names, etc. in case exact matches are not found.\n\nExample:\nif the Patch changes `src/lib/soup-foo.c` file,\n1. First, try to find the exact file in the OLD code base.\n2. If you cannot find the exact file, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history, to map filename of `src/lib/soup-foo.c` in the LATEST version to filename in the OLD version.\n3. if you still cannot find the exact file, try to find potential filenames using regex search or searching contents of file.\n4. Always check your findings with your knowledge of libsoup commit history, and ensure that file you found is indeed the correct file.\n\nExample:\nif the Patch changes a function named `soup_foo_bar()` in `src/soup_decoder/is-bar.c` file,\n1. First, try to find the exact function in the OLD code base.\n2. If you cannot find the exact function, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history, to map function name of `soup_foo_bar()` in the LATEST version to OLD version.\nfor example, it might be named `soup_foo_bar_v2()` in the OLD version, or it might have been moved to some other file, or broken into multiple functions, etc.\nbased on this, make a list of potential matches.\n\nTry to PRESERVE the original patch as much as possible, including comments and formatting.\nYou will be penalized for changes that deviate from the patch logic unnecessarily.\n\nMake sure that all your search, edits are within the `--code-base` directory.\nAny changes outside this directory will FAIL the task immediately.\n\nThe files & directories are very large.\nif you try to open a very large file, or list a very large directory, it will take up too many tokens and you will be penalized.\nSo, use commands like `find`, `grep`, etc. to locate files and functions and then use commands like `goto` to jump to specific lines.\n\nTo navigate/edit the codebase using the special interface, invoke the interface with a function call/tool call.\n\nGive special importance to the indentation and whitespaces in the code which are related to syntax.\nFor example, if you are looking at this file:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello world\")\n\nand you want to edit the file to read:\n\ndef fct():\n    print(\"Hello\")\n    print(\"world\")\n\nyour search string should be `Hello world` and your replace string should be `\"Hello\"\\n    print(\"world\")`\n(note the extra spaces before the print statement!).\nYou could also get the same result by search for `    print(\"Hello world\")` and replace with `    print(\"Hello\")\\n    print(\"world\")`.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>)\n(Current directory: <cwd>)\nbash-$\n\nFirst, you should ALWAYS include a general thought about what you're going to do next.\nThe thought should either be based on Last Observation or Your Libsoup Commit History knowledge.\nThen, for every response, you must include exactly ONE tool call/function call.\n\nNote that the special interface DOES NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them. Any command that require interactive session like \"git show\", \"git log\", etc., will not work. So, DON'T USE ANY INTERACTIVE SESSION COMMANDS OR THEIR DERIVATIVES LIKE `git log --grep=`, `git show HEAD`, `git diff --cached`, etc.,. When you want to run these commands, redirect them to a temporary file and open it for reading. For example, `git log --oneline > /backport/tmp/git_log.txt`.",

      "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n  If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n  Then start trying to fix it.\n  When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n  If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n  so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /testbed)\nbash-$",

      "content": "PROBLEM_STATEMENT:\n\nBackport the `original.patch` file to the `code_base` directory. Both the `original.patch` file and the `code_base` directory are available in the current working directory.\nFirst move the `original.patch` file to `/root/original.patch` and then change your working directory to the `code_base` directory by running `cd code_base`. \nNote that ANY Changes outside code_base directory, for instance to the original.patch file, will FAIL the task immediately.\n\nRead the patch file carefully and understand the changes it is making. Then, make the necessary changes in the code base, commit the changes, generate a new patch with `git format-patch -1 HEAD`, and then submit the changes using the `submit <patch_file>` command.\n\nYour git username is `AllSpark` and your email is `allspark@microsoft.com`.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your special-interface terminal session has started. You can use any bash NON-Interactive commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIf exact matches do not exist, use your knowledge of Libsoup commit history to find potential matches based on what files, functions of New Version Map to in the old version.\nNote that these are ONLY POTENTIAL matches, so make sure to verify them by checking the contents of the files and functions. use regex, `find`, `grep`, etc. to further improve your search.\nAlways understand the patch logic, the file content and ensure that the changes you are making are correct & preserve the original patch logic as much as possible.\n\nGENERAL IMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. It is okay to scroll only if you cannot determine the location by other means. Similarly when searching for a function, instead of scrolling down, use the search command to find the function name.\n\n3. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally to write code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it. ALWAYS USE PROPER INDENTATION WHEN EDITING FILES EVEN IF THE SYNTAX IS CORRECT WITHOUT INDENTATION. Code readability is important.\n\n4. Do not try to install any packages with `pip`, `conda`, or any other way. This is NOT ALLOWED. If the environment is not set up correctly, try to fix the issue without executing python code or running any tests that require the package installed. DO NOT Use interactive commands either. You have ONE toolcall per response, and the toolcall should be complete in itself. You wont be able to interact with it.\n\n5. Preserve the comments from the original patch whenever possible. They are important for understanding the code.\n\n6. In case exact matches are unavaialable, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history & New-Code to Old-Code mapping to find potential matches. But always verify your knowledge by checking the contents of the files and functions.\n\n7. You're working on a really big repo. So,  DO NOT use `ls -R` command to list all the files in the repo. Instead, use `find` command to find the files you want to edit. For example, if you want to find a file named `foo.py`, use `find . -name foo.py`.\nAlso make sure you understand interface limitations, OPEN files only, View directories only, etc.\n\nSTRATEGY:\n\n1. You don't need to worry about testing the fix. Try minimal self testing if available. But if it is not available or not running properly, don't worry about it.\n\n2. Read the changes to be applied from the original patch carefully. The `open` command only shows 100 lines, if the patch is longer make sure you scroll down to see the complete file. Make sure you understand all the chunks of the patch that need to be manually applied. Print all the description of changes it does in your thoughts as it will be served to you in the history in future prompts. And start making changes one by one.\n\n3. Locate relevant code using the find and search commands. `open` the file you want to edit. Use these tools most of the time to make yourself familier with the code base. Better understanding is preferred.\n\n4. Your knowlege of libsoup commit history is a powerful tool, list out in thoughts the 'Old-Code' to 'New-Code' mappings and use it to find potential file, function, line numbers.\nThis is NOT absolute, and you must verify your findings by checking the contents of the files and functions.\nTry this only once, and your potential matches not work, use special-interface commands to navigate and find the relevant code.\nAlways prefer codebase search over your knowledge of commit history.\n\n5. Use the `edit` command to perform edits.\n\nTOOL USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. The Tool Command 'OPEN' is ONLY to open files. DO NOT try to OPEN directories, this will FAIL the entire task instantly. Use 'VIEW' command to view directories, and 'OPEN' for files.\nFor example, DO NOT try to OPEN '/swe_repo/code_base/' since it is a directory and this will FAIL the entire task instantly.\n\n2. The file contents are TOO LARGE, if you try to OPEN entire file, it will take up too many tokens. Try to find function names, lines, etc using regex, or ask to cat 10-30 lines of file code at a time.\n\n3. Contents of Directories are TOO LARGE, do not try to use 'ls -R' on them. find specific files. use regex.\n\n4. Interactive Commands like 'vi' DO NOT WORK AT ALL. DO NOT USE THEM. If you try to use them, it will FAIL the entire task instantly. Use Commands like cat to open a file.\n\n5. You can Only Work on libsoup repo. (--code-repo). DO NOT try to open or edit any other files outside this repo. If you try to do so, it will FAIL the entire task instantly.\n   Do NOT in any way change the original patch. You DO NOT have permissions outside the code repo.\n\n(Open file: )\n(Current directory: /swe_repo)\nbash-$",

THIS is NOT the standard command line interface.\\nThis interface has its own Rules & limitations, work IN THOSE LIMITATIONS Only.\\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you {{WINDOW}} lines of a file at a time.\\nThe special interface DOES NOT allow any interactive commands like `vi`. Non interactive commands like `cat`, `find`, `grep`, etc are allowed.\\nAlso, it has some specific commands with PROPER LIMITATIONS: (like `OPEN` (File ONLY), `VIEW` (Directory ONLY) etc.)\\n\\nTo backport the patch, DO NOT Try to Cherrypick.\\nApply the patch MANUALLY.\\n\\nFirst, read the full patch and understand the changes in the patch.\\nThen, find what files, functions are being changed.\\nThen, locate those files and functions in the OLD code base.\\n\\nIf you cannot find an exact match, use your knowledge of Libsoup COMMIT HISTORY.\\nMention what files, functions in the LATEST version map to what files, functions in the OLD version.\\nThen based on this, mention potential filenames, functionnames that the Latest patch might be referring to in the Old code base.\\n\\nThen, use the special interface to search the codebase and make corresponding changes to the codebase based on the patch.\\nuse commands like `find`, `goto`, `grep`, etc. to find the relevant code in the OLD code base and backport the patch.\\nuse regex to find filenames/paths, function names, etc. in case exact matches are not found.\\n\\nExample:\\nif the Patch changes `src/lib/soup-foo.c` file,\\n1. First, try to find the exact file in the OLD code base.\\n2. If you cannot find the exact file, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history, to map filename of `src/lib/soup-foo.c` in the LATEST version to filename in the OLD version.\\n3. if you still cannot find the exact file, try to find potential filenames using regex search or searching contents of file.\\n4. Always check your findings with your knowledge of libsoup commit history, and ensure that file you found is indeed the correct file.\\n\\nExample:\\nif the Patch changes a function named `soup_foo_bar()` in `src/soup_decoder/is-bar.c` file,\\n1. First, try to find the exact function in the OLD code base.\\n2. If you cannot find the exact function, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history, to map function name of `soup_foo_bar()` in the LATEST version to OLD version.\\nfor example, it might be named `soup_foo_bar_v2()` in the OLD version, or it might have been moved to some other file, or broken into multiple functions, etc.\\nbased on this, make a list of potential matches.\\n\\nTry to PRESERVE the original patch as much as possible, including comments and formatting.\\nYou will be penalized for changes that deviate from the patch logic unnecessarily.\\n\\nMake sure that all your search, edits are within the `--code-base` directory.\\nAny changes outside this directory will FAIL the task immediately.\\n\\nThe files & directories are very large.\\nif you try to open a very large file, or list a very large directory, it will take up too many tokens and you will be penalized.\\nSo, use commands like `find`, `grep`, etc. to locate files and functions and then use commands like `goto` to jump to specific lines.\\n\\nTo navigate/edit the codebase using the special interface, invoke the interface with a function call/tool call.\\n\\nGive special importance to the indentation and whitespaces in the code which are related to syntax.\\nFor example, if you are looking at this file:\\n\\ndef fct():\\n    print(\\\"Hello world\\\")\\n\\nand you want to edit the file to read:\\n\\ndef fct():\\n    print(\\\"Hello\\\")\\n    print(\\\"world\\\")\\n\\nyour search string should be `Hello world` and your replace string should be `\\\"Hello\\\"\\\\n    print(\\\"world\\\")`\\n(note the extra spaces before the print statement!).\\nYou could also get the same result by search for `    print(\\\"Hello world\\\")` and replace with `    print(\\\"Hello\\\")\\\\n    print(\\\"world\\\")`.\\n\\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\\n(Open file: <path>)\\n(Current directory: <cwd>)\\nbash-$\\n\\nFirst, you should ALWAYS include a general thought about what you're going to do next.\\nThe thought should either be based on Last Observation or Your Libsoup Commit History knowledge.\\nThen, for every response, you must include exactly ONE tool call/function call.\\n\\nNote that the special interface DOES NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them. Any command that require interactive session like \\\"git show\\\", \\\"git log\\\", etc., will not work. So, DON'T USE ANY INTERACTIVE SESSION COMMANDS OR THEIR DERIVATIVES LIKE `git log --grep=`, `git show HEAD`, `git diff --cached`, etc.,. When you want to run these commands, redirect them to a temporary file and open it for reading. For example, `git log --oneline > /backport/tmp/git_log.txt`.\",\"instance_template\":\"PROBLEM_STATEMENT:\\n\\nBackport the `original.patch` file to the `code_base` directory. Both the `original.patch` file and the `code_base` directory are available in the current working directory.\\nFirst move the `original.patch` file to `/root/original.patch` and then change your working directory to the `code_base` directory by running `cd code_base`. \\nNote that ANY Changes outside code_base directory, for instance to the original.patch file, will FAIL the task immediately.\\n\\nRead the patch file carefully and understand the changes it is making. Then, make the necessary changes in the code base, commit the changes, generate a new patch with `git format-patch -1 HEAD`, and then submit the changes using the `submit <patch_file>` command.\\n\\nYour git username is `AllSpark` and your email is `allspark@microsoft.com`.\\n\\nINSTRUCTIONS:\\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your special-interface terminal session has started. You can use any bash NON-Interactive commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need.\\n\\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\\n\\nIf exact matches do not exist, use your knowledge of Libsoup commit history to find potential matches based on what files, functions of New Version Map to in the old version.\\nNote that these are ONLY POTENTIAL matches, so make sure to verify them by checking the contents of the files and functions. use regex, `find`, `grep`, etc. to further improve your search.\\nAlways understand the patch logic, the file content and ensure that the changes you are making are correct & preserve the original patch logic as much as possible.\\n\\nGENERAL IMPORTANT TIPS:\\n\\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\\n\\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. It is okay to scroll only if you cannot determine the location by other means. Similarly when searching for a function, instead of scrolling down, use the search command to find the function name.\\n\\n3. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally to write code with incorrect indentation or make other mistakes. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it. ALWAYS USE PROPER INDENTATION WHEN EDITING FILES EVEN IF THE SYNTAX IS CORRECT WITHOUT INDENTATION. Code readability is important.\\n\\n4. Do not try to install any packages with `pip`, `conda`, or any other way. This is NOT ALLOWED. If the environment is not set up correctly, try to fix the issue without executing python code or running any tests that require the package installed. DO NOT Use interactive commands either. You have ONE toolcall per response, and the toolcall should be complete in itself. You wont be able to interact with it.\\n\\n5. Preserve the comments from the original patch whenever possible. They are important for understanding the code.\\n\\n6. In case exact matches are unavaialable, use your knowledge of libsoup commit history & New-Code to Old-Code mapping to find potential matches. But always verify your knowledge by checking the contents of the files and functions.\\n\\n7. You're working on a really big repo. So,  DO NOT use `ls -R` command to list all the files in the repo. Instead, use `find` command to find the files you want to edit. For example, if you want to find a file named `foo.py`, use `find . -name foo.py`.\\nAlso make sure you understand interface limitations, OPEN files only, View directories only, etc.\\n\\nSTRATEGY:\\n\\n1. You don't need to worry about testing the fix. Try minimal self testing if available. But if it is not available or not running properly, don't worry about it.\\n\\n2. Read the changes to be applied from the original patch carefully. The `open` command only shows {{WINDOW}} lines, if the patch is longer make sure you scroll down to see the complete file. Make sure you understand all the chunks of the patch that need to be manually applied. Print all the description of changes it does in your thoughts as it will be served to you in the history in future prompts. And start making changes one by one.\\n\\n3. Locate relevant code using the find and search commands. `open` the file you want to edit. Use these tools most of the time to make yourself familier with the code base. Better understanding is preferred.\\n\\n4. Your knowlege of libsoup commit history is a powerful tool, list out in thoughts the 'Old-Code' to 'New-Code' mappings and use it to find potential file, function, line numbers.\\nThis is NOT absolute, and you must verify your findings by checking the contents of the files and functions.\\nTry this only once, and your potential matches not work, use special-interface commands to navigate and find the relevant code.\\nAlways prefer codebase search over your knowledge of commit history.\\n\\n5. Use the `edit` command to perform edits.\\n\\nTOOL USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:\\n\\n1. The Tool Command 'OPEN' is ONLY to open files. DO NOT try to OPEN directories, this will FAIL the entire task instantly. Use 'VIEW' command to view directories, and 'OPEN' for files.\\nFor example, DO NOT try to OPEN '/swe_repo/code_base/' since it is a directory and this will FAIL the entire task instantly.\\n\\n2. The file contents are TOO LARGE, if you try to OPEN entire file, it will take up too many tokens. Try to find function names, lines, etc using regex, or ask to cat 10-30 lines of file code at a time.\\n\\n3. Contents of Directories are TOO LARGE, do not try to use 'ls -R' on them. find specific files. use regex.\\n\\n4. Interactive Commands like 'vi' DO NOT WORK AT ALL. DO NOT USE THEM. If you try to use them, it will FAIL the entire task instantly. Use Commands like cat to open a file.\\n\\n5. You can Only Work on libsoup repo. (--code-repo). DO NOT try to open or edit any other files outside this repo. If you try to do so, it will FAIL the entire task instantly.\\n   Do NOT in any way change the original patch. You DO NOT have permissions outside the code repo.\\n\\n(Open file: {{open_file}})\\n(Current directory: {{working_dir}})\\nbash-$\",\"next_step_template\":\"{{observation}}\\n(Open file: {{open_file}})\\n(Current directory: {{working_dir}})\\nbash-$\",\"next_step_truncated_observation_template\":\"Observation: {{observation}}<response clipped><NOTE>Observations should not exceeded {{max_observation_length}} characters. {{elided_chars}} characters were elided.
