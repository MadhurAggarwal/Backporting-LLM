To determine the line numbers based on the provided patch and file code, let's analyze the patch and the file content step-by-step.

### Patch Analysis
The patch modifies the `soup-content-sniffer.c` file. Specifically, it changes the following line:

**Before:**
```c
while ((index_stream < resource_length) &&
```

**After:**
```c
while ((index_stream < resource_length - 1) &&
```

### File Code Analysis
The relevant portion of the file code is:

```c
524: 		if (!sniff_scriptable && type_row->scriptable)
525: 			continue;
526: 
527: 		if (type_row->has_ws) {
528: 			guint index_stream = 0;
529: 			guint index_pattern = 0;
530: 			gboolean skip_row = FALSE;
531: 
532: 			while ((index_stream < resource_length) &&
533: 			       (index_pattern <= type_row->pattern_length)) {
534: 				/* Skip insignificant white space ("WS" in the spec) */
535: 				if (type_row->pattern[index_pattern] == ' ') {
536: 					if (resource[index_stream] == '\x09' ||
537: 					    resource[index_stream] == '\x0a' ||
538: 					    resource[index_stream] == '\x0c' ||
539: 					    resource[index_stream] == '\x0d' ||
540: 					    resource[index_stream] == '\x20')
541: 						index_stream++;
542: 					else
543: 						index_pattern++;
544: 				} else {
545: 					if ((type_row->mask[index_pattern] & resource[index_stream]) != type_row->pattern[index_pattern]) {
546: 						skip_row = TRUE;
547: 						break;
548: 					}
```

### Identifying Lines
1. **First Mentioned Unchanged Line**: This refers to the first line in the patch that is unchanged. In the patch, the first unchanged line is:
   ```c
   while ((index_stream < resource_length) &&
   ```
   This line appears in the file at line number **532**.

2. **First Changed Line**: This refers to the first line in the patch that is changed. In the patch, the first changed line is:
   ```c
   while ((index_stream < resource_length - 1) &&
   ```
   This line also appears in the file at line number **532**, but with the change applied.

### Conclusion
- **First Mentioned Unchanged Line Number**: 532
- **First Changed Line Number**: 532

So, the output is:
```
First Mentioned Unchanged Line Number: 532
First Changed Line Number: 532
```
