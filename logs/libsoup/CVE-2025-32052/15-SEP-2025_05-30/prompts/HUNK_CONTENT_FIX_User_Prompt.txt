    The downstream file code has diverged from upstream.
    Here, the line content in the diverged file is:
532: 			while ((index_stream < resource_length) &&
533: 			       (index_pattern <= type_row->pattern_length)) {
534: 				/* Skip insignificant white space ("WS" in the spec) */
535: 				if (type_row->pattern[index_pattern] == ' ') {

    TASK:
    The upstream patch uses different whitespace, tabs etc. than the downstream code
    Also some lines could be missing / extra in the new file code, from when the patch was created.
    So, update the patch to the new line content.

    Ensure that the patch logic is NOT changed.
    Ensure that line content like newlines, tabs, whitespace etc matches the downstream file code.

    Do NOT give any extra tokens like diff ``` or <patch>.
    Only output the final patch in STANDARD GIT diff format.
